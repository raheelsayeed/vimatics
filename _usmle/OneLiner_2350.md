A broad-spectrum antibiotic from the carbapenem class, is administered. Imipenem is often coadministered with cilastatin, an inhibitor of dehydropeptidase-1, an enzyme in the brush border of the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidneys that metabolizes imipenem. By inhibiting this enzyme, cilastatin maintains effective serum levels of imipenem and prevents the nephrotoxicity that can be caused by imipenem metabolites. However, renal function must be assessed before administration of cilastatin and imipenem. Eg to TX: pseudomonal pneumonia.
