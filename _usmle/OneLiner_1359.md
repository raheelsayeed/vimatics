An increase in the speed of AV node conduction would be dangerous for a patient with AF because this would cause the ventricles to fire at an even faster rate. Although diltiazem does have some effect on vascular smooth muscle, it has more of an effect on the heart (while verapamil has even less of an effect on vascular smooth muscle). Also, what little effect it does have is to decrease vascular resistance, lowering blood pressure and resulting in atrial tachycardia, which would, again, be dangerous for a patient with AF. Although prolongation of the QT interval (prolonged ventricular depolarization) would be beneficial because it would prolong the refractory period of the ventricles, thus helping to protect it
