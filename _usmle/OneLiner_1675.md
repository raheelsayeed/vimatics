Methemoglobinemia - weakness, dizziness, and dyspnea, while appearing to be cyanotic, all of which are signs and symptoms of poor tissue perfusion. Oxidizing agents (i.e. Dapsone) can cause methemoglobinemia (muddy color blood) -> oxygen-carrying iron is present in the oxidized (ferric Fe3+) state instead of the reduced (ferrous Fe2+) state.
