Thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, are oral hypoglycemic agents that increase peripheral sensitivity to insulin by binding to and stimulating the activity of nuclear transcription factors called peroxisome proliferatorâ€“activated receptors. This decreases blood glucose levels. Thiazolidinediones also decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis.
