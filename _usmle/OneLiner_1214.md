Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) medication typically reserved for patients with major depression who have failed first-line therapy (ie, SSRIs). Other indications for TCAs include peripheral neuropathy, chronic pain, and migraine prophylaxis. TCAs have a wide variety of adverse side effects, including Convulsions, Coma and Cardiotoxicity. Therefore, a TCA like amitriptyline is not the first-line treatment of choice for social anxiety disorder.
