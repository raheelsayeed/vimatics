Hydatidiform moles are cystic swellings of the chorionic villi with little to no associated fetal tissue. They often come to clinical attention in the fourth and fifth months of pregnancy with vaginal bleeding. the uterus is larger than expected for gestational age, and the serum BHCG level is higher than normal. Partial moles may contain some fetal tissue but no viable fetus, some normal villi, and some vesicular/abnormal chorionic villi. A complete mole contains no fetal tissue and completely vesicular/abnormal chorionic villi. Hydatidiform moles must be removed because they may lead to choriocarcinoma, an aggressive neoplasm that metastasizes early but is very responsive to chemotherapy.
