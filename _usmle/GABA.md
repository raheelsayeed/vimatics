Enhancement of CNS inhibitory neurotransmitter activity can improve spasticity.  GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS and acts on two different receptors: GABA A receptor mediates a fast response to GABA because it is an ion-gated chloride channel.  Activation of this receptor leads to rapid muscle relaxation and sedation.  Its activity is enhanced by benzodiazepines, which can be used to treat spasticity. GABA B receptor mediates a slower response to GABA because it is mediated by a G protein–coupled receptor that opens potassium channels.  It is agonized by baclofen, which can also be used to treat spasticity.
