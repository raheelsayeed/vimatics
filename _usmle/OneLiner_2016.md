Endometritis is the inflammation of the endometrium of the uterus. This condition is associated with retained products of conception after delivery, miscarriage, or abortion. However, it can also be caused by foreign objects in the uterus, such as an IUD. The retained material in the uterus promotes infection by bacterial flora from the vagina. The bacteria most commonly associated with endometritis are Ureaplasma, Gardnerella, group B strep, and Chlamydia. Chronic endometritis is characterized by the presence of plasma cells in the stroma.
