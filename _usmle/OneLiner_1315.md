Niacin inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue, thereby reducing hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis. Niacin is most effective in raising HDL cholesterol, which has not been proven to improve cardiovascular disease outcomes. Because of its side effect profile, niacin is generally used only in dyslipidemia that is refractory to treatment with other lipid-lowering agents.
