Retained primary teeth, thickening of facial soft tissue (ie, leathery appearance of the face), and a history of recurrent skin infections without erythema -> IgE syndrome (Job syndrome). Gene mutation in STAT3. In this disease, TH17 cells fail to produce interleukin-17 (IL-17), leading to an inability of neutrophils to respond to chemotactic stimuli. Consequently, the inflammatory response is blunted in these patients, resulting in frequent staphylococcal abscesses that lack the expected warmth and erythema ("cold abscesses"). The presence and activation of immunoglobulin E (IgE) leads to eczema. A method to memorize the findings of Job syndrome is the FATED mnemonic: Facies that are coarse, Abscesses that are cold, Teeth that are retained (baby), E is increased (IgE), Dermatologic problems.
