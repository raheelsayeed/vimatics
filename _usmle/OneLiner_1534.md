Lab tests show an elevation in partial thromboplastin time, a prolonged bleeding time, and a normal prothrombin time. These findings are characteristic of patients on heparin, and her extreme thrombocytopenia suggests heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Patients with HIT should be immediately started on a direct thrombin inhibitor, such as argatroban or bivalirudin, to prevent thrombosis.
