The rate-limiting step of fatty acid synthesis involves acetyl-CoA carboxylation via acetyl-CoA carboxylase + biotin cofactor to form malonyl-CoA, a substrate for fatty acid synthase. Malonyl-CoA is also an inhibitor of the carnitine shuttle, which transfers fatty acids into the mitochondria, thereby inhibiting the rate-limiting step of Î²-oxidation of fatty acids.
