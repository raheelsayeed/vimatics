A patient presents with ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and confusion, which are symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy. This syndrome is caused by a thiamine deficiency that is most commonly seen in malnourished alcoholic patients. Other clues that this is an alcoholic patient is ascites, likely due to alcoholic cirrhosis. Thiamine, also known as vitamin B1, is used as a cofactor for multiple enzymes, including Î±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and transketolase.
