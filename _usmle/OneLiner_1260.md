Infection with arbovirus, an enveloped positive sense ssRNA, is seen in all age groups; however symptoms are more severe in the elderly and immunocompromised. Arboviruses are transmitted via blood transfusions and mosquito vectors; birds and horses are also hosts. Meningitis that is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, a gram-positive diplococcus, manifests with much more severe symptoms than are seen in this patient. Laboratory values would show a predominance of polymorphonuclear neutrophils as opposed to lymphocytes. Glucose would also be decreased.
