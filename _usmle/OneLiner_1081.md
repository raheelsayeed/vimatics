Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic neoplasm seen in older adults that is caused by a proliferation of myeloid lineage WBCs, as shown in this patientâ€™s peripheral blood smear. CML is defined by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome [t(9,22)], which results in the production of the fusion protein, Bcr-Abl. Imatinib is a first-line treatment for CML, and a kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits the aberrant Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase by blocking its adenosine triphosphate-binding site. This inhibits the abnormal function of the fusion oncoprotein.
