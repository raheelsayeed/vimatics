Methotrexate. Methotrexate is a chemotherapeutic agent associated with myelosuppression. It is an S phase-specific antimetabolite that acts as a folic acid analog and reversibly inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, interfering with nucleotide synthesis. Myelosuppression that is reversible with leucovorin (folinic acid). Leucovorin bypasses the block created by methotrexate by supplying folinic acid, the necessary factor for DNA synthesis, and allowing for bone marrow repletion.
