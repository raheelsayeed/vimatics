CMV can cause subclinical infection in the immunocompetent, developing a mononucleosis-like syndrome that is heterophile antibody (Monospot) negative, unlike EBV. In an immunocompromised, primary or reactivated CMV infection can result in severe retinitis, pneumonia, esophagitis, colitis, or hepatitis.
