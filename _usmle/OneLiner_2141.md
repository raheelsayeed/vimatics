Hypersexuality, hyperorality (fixation on oral exploration), and disinhibited behavior are suggestive of Klüver-Bucy syndrome, a constellation of symptoms that can also include visual agnosia, anterograde amnesia, and decreased emotional responsiveness. It results from damage to the amygdala bilaterally, usually secondary to ischemic stroke. His chronically high blood pressure places him at risk for stroke, a strong risk factor for the development of Klüver-Bucy syndrome. Other causes of amygdala injury include infection (encephalitis) and trauma.
