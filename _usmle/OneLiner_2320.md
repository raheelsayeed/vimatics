The patient’s 24-hour urine collection demonstrates proteinuria. Proteinuria in the setting of MM is referred to as Bence-Jones proteinuria, with a major criterion being >1 g of protein in 24 hours. Creatinine clearance helps define the severity of the patient’s renal impairment. Bence-Jones proteins are monoclonal free light chains produced by malignant plasma cells (which are small enough to be easily excreted in the urine).
