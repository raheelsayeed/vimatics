Astrocytes give rise to astrocytomas and glioblastomas, which constitute the largest group of primary brain tumors. Low-grade astrocytomas are slow-growing malignant tumors that are typically found in the posterior fossa as an enhancing irregular cerebellar mass. Low-grade astrocytomas are more common in children while high-grade astrocytomas and glioblastomas are more common in adults and carry grave prognoses.
