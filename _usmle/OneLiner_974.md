A presents with a murmur on auscultation that is loudest during S2. A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) can produce a continuous, machine-like murmur, like that heard in the audio clip. During normal development, the proximal part of the left sixth aortic arch becomes the proximal part of the left pulmonary arteries, and the distal part becomes the ductus arteriosus. The proximal part of the right 6th aortic arch forms the right pulmonary artery, and the distal part degenerates.
