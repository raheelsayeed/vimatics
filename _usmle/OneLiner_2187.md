ADH is produced by the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalmus. It stimulates water reabsorption by increasing the number of aquaporins inserted in the luminal membrane of principal cells of the collecting ducts of nephrons. Excessive secretion of ADH thus causes inappropriate reabsorption of water, diluting the extracellular fluid of the body, resulting in the presenting symptoms and laboratory results.
