### Type 1 (alpha) error

- False positive
- Finding difference/effect when there is NONE in reality
- Rejecting Null Hypothesis (H0) when you should not have!
- eg:
    > Researchers conclude that a drug benefits patients but it does not.
    - Null Hypothesis not rejected unless Alpha < 0.05

### Type II (beta) error

- False Negative
- Experiment finds no difference in affect when there was one!
- We accepted Null Hypothesis when we shouldn't have
- > Researchers conclude a drug does NOT benefit, when it actually did.
