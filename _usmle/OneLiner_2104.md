Pt with HIV currently undergoing (HAART) presents with signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis: sudden epigastric pain that radiates to the back, periumbilical bruising, nausea, vomiting, fever, and increased amylase, lipase, and hematocrit. Didanosine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that is part of HAART used to treat HIV/AIDS. MOA is competitive inhibition of nucleotide binding to reverse transcriptase and termination of the DNA chain. It requires phosphorylation to be active. Severe adverse effects include pancreatitis and hepatitis.
