Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) is secreted from squamous cell carcinomas (most commonly of the lung) and is considered evidence of a paraneoplastic syndrome. PTHrP acts like parathyroid hormone (PTH) to increase serum calcium levels by increasing bone resorption and renal reabsorption of calcium. PTHrP stimulates conversion of inactive 25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D to active 1,25-OH vitamin D, resulting in increased calcium and phosphate reabsorption in the intestines.
