Minimal change disease (lipoid nephrosis) is characterized by normal-appearing glomeruli under light microscopy, and foot process effacement under electron microscopy. It is common in children 2-8 years of age, has a male:female ratio of 2:1, and manifests with nephrotic syndrome. It can cause proteinuria, but not lytic bone lesions or increased gamma globulin on serum protein electrophoresis.
