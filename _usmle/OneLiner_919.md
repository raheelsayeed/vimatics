Like ranibizumab, bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody against VEGF that is used to treat several solid tumors, including colon, breast, and non-small cell lung cancers. It is given in combination with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin or irinotecan. The main adverse effects are hypertension and elevated risk of bleeding.
