Branched chain ɑ-ketoacid dehydrogenase is deficient in maple syrup urine disease in which degradation of branched amino acids is impaired leading to elevated levels of their ɑ-ketoacids in the blood. Maple syrup urine disease is named so due to its characteristic burnt smelling urine. It can lead to severe CNS defects, intellectual disability and death.
