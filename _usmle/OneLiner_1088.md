Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. G6PD is an important enzyme in the hexose monophosphate shunt. It reduces nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) to NADPH, which in turn reduces glutathione (GSSG to GSH) via glutathione reductase. GSH, the reduced form of glutathione, protects against oxidant injury by reducing such compounds as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to H2O.
