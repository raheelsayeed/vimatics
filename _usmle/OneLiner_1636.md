Recurrent sinus and ear infections, along with reduced serum immunoglobulin levels, absent tonsils, and absent germinal centers on lymph-node biopsy. This is suggestive of X-linked agammaglobulinemia, an inherited condition caused by a defect in the gene coding for Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). This protein is crucial for the maturation of B cells, and in its absence, patients have decreased immune function and increased risk of bacterial infections. TX: administration of intravenous γ-globulin injections which passively improves the patient’s immune function.
