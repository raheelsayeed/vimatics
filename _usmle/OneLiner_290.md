RA â€“ involves autoantibodies against citrullinated polypeptides & activation of CD4+ T cells, especially Th1 & Th17. TNF-Alpha & IL-1 are involved. Proteases (e.g., collagenase, metalloproteinase) contributes to cartilage destruction. TX: Monoclonal antibodies that inhibit TNF-alpha (e.g., adalimumab, etanercept) or IL-1 receptors (e.g., anakinra) are widely used in the treatment of RA & can slow progression of the disease.
