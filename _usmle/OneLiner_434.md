Class I antiarrhythmic drugs block sodium channels that inhibit initial phase 0 depolaization of action potential, thereby slowing conduction. Class 1A agents also have moderate potassium channel-blocking activity, leading to a slow rate of repolarization & prolongation of action potential duration in the cardia myocytes.
