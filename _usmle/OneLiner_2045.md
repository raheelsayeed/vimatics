Intussusception>>episodic abdominal pain with nausea, vomiting, fever, and a palpable abdominal mass. No loose or frequent stools. Intussusception>telescoping of one segment of bowel into another, which results in obstruction. Common in children 1â€“5 years of age. Sudden onset, pain is intermittent ("colicky") in nature & reflects a partial reversal of obstruction and the affected small intestine becoming transiently acontractile.  Vomiting indicates worsening obstruction. Other features >>currant jelly stool and an abdominal mass, which is classically sausage shaped and located in the right upper quadrant. The most common site for intussusception is near the ileocecal junction. Meckel diverticula and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes can serve as lead points for intussusception. Intussusception can be a complication of Henoch-Schonlein Purpura, and, in these instances, the obstruction is most likely ileoileal. Intussusception is a medical emergency, and air enema is used for both diagnosis and treatment. In cases with intestinal perforation, surgery is indicated.
