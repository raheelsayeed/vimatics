Alpha-thalassemia is a disorder characterized by deletions of the alpha globin gene, which codes for the alpha subunit of hemoglobin. These patients can have associated hemolytic anemia secondary to destruction of RBCs (which are unstable secondary to the build-up of hemoglobin molecules made with 4 beta globin proteins)
