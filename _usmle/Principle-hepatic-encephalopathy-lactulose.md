### Normally: liver is the detox organ that converts ammonia to Urea that is eventually excreted in kidney. 

### Liver damage: (Cirrhosis, etc)

Liver is unable to convert ammonia to harmless Urea. Ammonia accumulates, goes through to the brain, penetrates the blood brain barrier and causes encephalopathy

### Treatment: Lactulose

Lactulose is a diasaccharide --> acidifies colonic content --> absorbable ammonia to non absorbable ammonium ions --> excreted/trapped in stool --> fecal nitrogen excretion Increase
