Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is an important differential for patients with possible lupus nephritis because FSGS occurs more commonly in patients with SLE. Lupus nephritis results from the deposition of glomerular immune complexes, which activate the complement cascade and lead to complement-mediated damage. In contrast, FSGS has appearances of segmental sclerosis and hyalinosis. Treatment of lupus nephritis consists of high-dose steroids combined with either cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil.
