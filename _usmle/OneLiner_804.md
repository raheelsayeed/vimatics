During vigorous exercise, there is increased oxygen extraction from hemoglobin and increased carbon dioxide production. These changes would lead to a decrease in mixed venous oxygen saturation and an increase in venous partial carbon dioxide pressure. Additionally, during exercise, there is an increase in pulmonary blood flow, which results in improved ventilation/perfusion matching.
