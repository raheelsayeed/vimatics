# Nerves

## ULNAR: little finger, Guyon's canal

- injured at two sites:
    1. hook of hamate
    2. below medial epicondyle of humerus

- Ulnar claw deformity: Distal ulnar nerve

## Posterial Dislocation of Medial epicondyle --> Ulnar injury 



---- 


# Median Nerve

## Medial/Lateral cords --> with Brachial Artery between biceps and triceps --> Forearm --> coarses between the medial and ulnar heads of PRONATOR TERES and traverses ---> between flexar digitorums superficialis and flexar digitorum profundus


## Carpal tunnel: pregnancy, hypothyroidism --> compression: median nerve --> weakness of first 2 fingers

## Anteromedial supracondylar dislocation --> MedianN injury and Brachial Artery injury --> Loss of radial pulse 

------

# Radial N

## Midshaft humerus fracture --> radial nerve injury

- wrist drop
- sensory loss: dosrso lateral side of forearm

## Anterolateral supracondylar dislocation --> Radial N injury


------

# Shoulder


## Fracture of head of humerus --> __Axillary Nerve__ injury 

- paralysis of __DELTOID, TERESMINOR__ 
- sensory loss of lateral shoulder 
- DELTOID injury ---> Loss of abduction 30-100 degrees

## Drooping of shoulder, Impaired abduction of arm > 100 degrees, lateral displacement of scapula ----> TRAPEZIUS (SPINAL ACCESSORY N, 12) 

- __SPINAL ACCESSORY N__ also supplis --> __SCM__ 
- injury Posterior Triangle of Neck

## WINGED SCAPULA, loss of assistance of elevation of arm upward ---> Long Thoraci N injuring Serratus Anterior


## SHOULDER Dislocation? Upper arm extreme activity (baseball pitch) --> Arm Flexing, loss of cutaneous sensation over lateral forarm --> Musculocutaneous Nerve --> C5-7

- supplies biceps brachi and brachialis (FLEXORS)
-  Coracobrachialis (ADDUCTS ARM)`

-----------------------

# Leg

### Injury to Fibula Neck fracture --> Common Fibular(Peroneal)  Nerve --> Superficial/Deep fibular nerve injury 

- Loss of sensation of dorsum of foot
- loss of eversion of foot

-----------------------


# Tongue 

### Recurrent and External Laryngeal N --> Motor fibres --> vocal cords 
### Internal Laryngeal N --> Sensory fibres --> Sensory/Autonomic  (afferent limb of cough reflex) from mucosa superior to the vocal cords
