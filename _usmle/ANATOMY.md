# Nerves

## ULNAR: little finger, Guyon's canal

- injured at two sites:
    1. hook of hamate
    2. below medial epicondyle of humerus

- Ulnar claw deformity: Distal ulnar nerve


## Carpal tunnel: pregnancy, hypothyroidism --> compression: median nerve --> weakness of first 2 fingers

## Midshaft humerus fracture --> radial nerve injury

- wrist drop
- sensory loss: dosrso lateral side of forearm


## Fracture of head of humerus --> __Axillary Nerve__ injury 

- paralysis of __DELTOID, TERESMINOR__ 
- sensory loss of lateral forarm 
- DELTOID injury ---> Loss of abduction 30-100 degrees

## Drooping of shoulder, Impaired abduction of arm > 100 degrees, lateral displacement of scapula ----> TRAPEZIUS (SPINAL ACCESSORY N, 12) 

- __SPINAL ACCESSORY N__ also supplis --> __SCM__ 
- injury Posterior Triangle of Neck

## WINGED SCAPULA, loss of assistance of elevation of arm upward ---> Long Thoraci N injuring Serratus Anterior


## SHOULDER Dislocation? Upper arm extreme activity (baseball pitch) --> Arm Flexing, loss of cutaneous sensation over lateral forarm --> Musculocutaneous Nerve --> C5-7

- supplies biceps brachi and brachialis (FLEXORS)
-  Coracobrachialis (ADDUCTS ARM)`


## Prostate surgery injury --> Erectile dysfunction --> injury to prostatic plexus (coming from pelvic splanchnic nerves) --> outflow to lesser and greater cavernous nerves 

## L1,L2 injury --> cremasteric reflux
