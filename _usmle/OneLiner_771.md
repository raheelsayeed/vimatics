Stridor that is worse when supine and that persists when he is feeding or becomes agitated. This symptom together with the bulky arytenoid cartilages seen on laryngoscopy are suggestive of laryngomalacia. The arytenoid cartilages arise as swellings from the sixth pharyngeal (branchial) arch at 32 days of gestation.
