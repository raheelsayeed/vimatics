### DIRECT ACTION: __Insulin__ --(-)> Pancreatic Alpha Cells --> Decreases release of Glucagon 


#### Hormone Sensitive Lipase 

- Fed: ACTH / Epinephrine
- Fasting: Insulin


#### Infantile Parkinsonism

- Tyrosine ===|TyrosineHydroxylase|===> DOPA 
- Deficiency of TH => Infantile Parkinsonism

#### Acanthosis Nigrans sign of Insulin Resistance

- Inc FFA --(-)> insulin dependent glu update
- Obesity
- Sendantary lifestyle

#### CONCEPT: patients with Type1DM or chronic pancreatitis eventually may have higher __hypoglycemic__ events

- Eventually pancreatic alpha cells get damanged --> Decreased Glucagon release --> Less production of Glucose!

#### Lisosomal disease:

- Adolecent, presenting with neuropathic pain in palms and soles
- less sweating
- This is __Fabry's disease__
- Accumulation of Gb3 (ceremide trihexioside) in
    1. small nerves: sever distal extremety pain and swelling and distal loss of hot/cold temp
    2. vascular smooth muscle: angiokeratomas, telangiectasias
    3. angiokeratomas: non blanching, occur in clusters in buttocks, groin, umbelicus
    4. ADULTHOOD:  (also CoD)
        - cardiac problems: (LVH)
        - cerebrovascular problems (TIA)
        - renal: glumurlus, distal tubule: proteinuria


#### GHRH --> GH(Apit) --> IGF-1(LIVER) --> Growth Effects (bone, cartilate, skeletal muscle, soft tissues

- GIGANTISM

#### Lady, wants to loose a ton of weight before marrige in a few weeks. What meds?

- Sympathomimmetics: only short term
- orlistat
- bupropion/naltrexone


#### Glucagonoma: What is the skin lesion?

- uw-id=585
- NECROLYTIC MIGRATORY ERYTHEMA
- blistering erythematic plaques with central clearing --> brown or bronze colored
- groin, face, extrimities

#### Female athelete --> Low BMI --> Less fat stores --> Reduced circulating Leptin --> Leptin --(-)> GnRH (pulsatile) --> Decrease FSH, LH --> Decreased Estrogen --> Amenorrhea

- LEPTIN inhibits GnRH
- Functionaly Hypothalamic Amennorhea (FHA)

#### Layers of Adrenal Cortex (Outer to Inner) --> G F R 

- Outer layer tumor --> Hyperaldosteronism (Conn)
    - electrolyte imbalance --> parasthesias, muscle weakness

#### Conn vs Pheochromo (Both High BP)

- Conn: parasthesias, muscle wekaness, low Renin Activity
- pheochromo: High Renin Activity (stimulation!), techycardia, sweating, palpitations

### Onset of Hashimotos --> 45-65 yrs

### Hypercalcemia, Kidney stones, Constipation

- MEN 1 symptoms
- 3Ps
    1. Pancreatic
    2. Parathyroid
    3. Pituitary

#### Cortisol --(+)-> PMNT

- NE ---|PMNT|--> Epi 
- promoted by Cortisol
- lack of cortisol reduces Epi production
- expression of PMNT is upregulated by Cortisol (Permissive Action)



#### Loss of smell + gonadal dysgenesis = KALLMAN syndrome

- Loss of GnRH producing secretory neurons in Hypothalamus --> Decreasd LH/FSH 
- Defective migration --> Olfactory placade
