The first step in hemodynamic management of shock is fluid resuscitation. It alone often provides adequate hemodynamic support; however, if fluid resuscitation is insufficient, administration of vasopressors (drugs which increase systemic venous resistance) and/or inotropes (drugs which increase cardiac contractility) may be necessary. Norepinephrine is the first-line agent of choice in the treatment of hypovolemic and septic shock.
