Dandy-Walker syndrome is a congenital noncommunicating hydrocephalus typically associated with a cluster of abnormal findings that include abnormal formation of the cerebellar vermis. This condition leads to obstruction of the outlet foramina of Luschka and Magendie. The MRI would reveal a largely absent cavity in place of the cerebellum, and clinically the patient would have symptoms present in infancy.
