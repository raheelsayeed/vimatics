Patients with granulomatous diseases (sarcoidosis, tuberculosis) can have PTH-independent conversion of vit D due to expression of 1-a-hydroxylase in activated macrophages. Similar process occurs in Hodgkin, and some non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Factors affecting K+ excretion: hyperkalemia, increased aldosterone (enhances Na-K pump), alkalosis (promotes K+ entry), increased fluid flow in the DCT (volume expansion, high Na intake, diuretics). Hypokalemia: alpha-intercalated cells reabsorb K+; Principal cells secrete K+ in hyperkalemia
Cryptogenic stroke – patent foramen ovale (PTO) and atrial septal defect (ASD); incomplete fusion in 25% of healthy adults of septum primum and septum secundum, with increased right atrial pressure relative to left atrium can cause shunting of blood, and “air bubbles” to pass through in diagnostic echocardiogram with agitated normal saline injection. Hypercoagubility (OCPs) can cause paradoxical brain embolism.
PPI’s inhibit hydrogen-potassium ATPase pump & decrease HCL. The resultant increase in gastric pH leads to increased gastrin formation which induces hypertrophy of the ECL & parietal cells. 
Withdrawal of PPI’s results in overstimulation of parietal cells with hyperfunctioning of the blocked ATPase, leading to rebound gastric acid hypersecretion & reflux symptoms. PPI’s can be slowly tapered to prevent this adverse effect. 
Somatostatin inhibits histamine & gastrin release; upregulation would lead to reduced gastric acid formation.

Cholesteatomas are a collection of squamous cell debris that form a round pearly mass behind the tympanic membrane in the middle ear. Painless otorrhea but can secrete lytic enzymes that erode ossicles -> conductive hearing loss. Vertigo/facial paralysis rare but can happen if large enough.
Rb tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 13q14 regulates G1 -> S checkpoint. Active (hypophosphorylated) or inactive (hyperphosphorylated) -> inactive ones allow defective DNA to proceed and is linked with retinoblastoma, osteosarcoma, breast adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma of the lung, and bladder cancer.
Normally, PaCO2 is the major driver for stimulating central chemoreceptors, but in COPD pts with CO2 retention, sensitivity to CO2 is lost, and hypoxia (O2) becomes the main driver. Peripheral chemoreceptors (carotid bodies) which are responsible for sending PaO2 are suppressed with O2 therapy.

DDAVP therapy in Central Diabetes insipidus & Nocturnal enuresis binds to V2 receptors in the renal tubular cells, leading to increased aquaporin channels, increased water reabsorption & decreased urine output. 
vWD – AD deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF). vWF is secreted by endothelial cells & circulates in multimers that are non-covalently attached to clotting factor VIII, increasing his stability. 
vWD is also responsible for augmenting platelet binding at endothelial injury sites, which helps in the formation of the platelet plug. 
Syringomyelia – formation of a cavity (syrinx) in the cervical region of the spinal cord -> damages the ventral white commissure -> bilateral loss of pain and temperature limited to that level (usually hands)
Fertility treatments: IVF in Turner’s Syndrome pts.; bromocriptine (dopamine agonist) in hyperprolactinemia; Clomiphene (antiestrogen) in pts with ovulatory failure who are normogonadotropic, normoprolacatinemic, euthyroid; Pulsatile GnRH infusion with disordered GnRH secretion; hCG in oocyte donor to trigger ovulatory cascade

Beginning at approximately age 30, there is a gradual decline in FEV1 with age. 
V/Q mismatch occurs when alveoli is ventilated but not perfused -> diseases that increase physiologic dead space, such as pulmonary embolism and malignancies that obstruct arterial blood flow.
Viridans Streptococci – Normal inhabitants of oral cavity & cause transient bacteremia after dental procedures. It is Gram positive & capable of producing extracellular polysaccharides (dextrans) using sucrose as a substrate. Dextrans facilitate streptococcal adherence to fibrin. Fibrin & platelets are deposited at sites of endothelial trauma, providing a site for bacterial adherence & colonization during bacteremia. 
Staphylococcus Aureus is more aggressive & can adhere to intact valves whereas in patients with pre-existing valvular lesions, viridans streptococci can adhere to the affected valve & establish infection leading to endocarditis.  
Circulating heparins prolong the partial thromboplastin time by activating antithrombin III, thereby decreasing thrombin & ultimately preventing fibrinogen conversion to fibrin, thereby preventing clot formation. 
Achalasia – Esophageal motility disorder characterized by absence of esophageal peristalsis in the distal esophagus & incomplete relaxation of a hypertonic lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Achalasia is caused by the immune mediated destruction of inhibitory ganglion cells. 
Botulinum toxin, a neurotoxin formed by Clostridium botulinum, prevents the fusion of acetylcholine-containing synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane. This prevents acetylcholine release into the neuromuscular synapse, resulting in muscle weakness & paralysis. 
In a patient with Achalasia, injection with botulinum toxin into the LES causes cholinergic blockade, leading to sphincter relaxation and improvement of symptoms. 
Mitral valve prolapse – defects in connective tissue proteins that predispose to myxomatous degeneration of the mitral leaflets and chordae tendineae. Mid-systolic click with mitral regurgitation murmur -> occur later in systole or disappear completely with squatting and valsava maneuvers that increase left ventricular end-diastolic volume.
GLP-1 agonists (e.g., liraglutide) increase glucose dependent insulin secretion. They cause delayed gastric emptying & decreased appetite. 
Hepatitis C virus – multiple genotypes and sub-genotypes with hypervariable genomic regions -> there is no proofreading 3’-5’ exonuclease activity built into the virion-encoded RNA polymerase -> makes many errors during replication -> resultant several dozen subspecies
5’-3’ exonuclease activity allows DNA polymerase I to engage nick translation -> DNA repair and removal of RNA primers during replication
Endotracheal intubation can acutely worsen vertebral malalignment (sublaxation) from long-standing rheumatoid arthritis that can affect atlantoaxial joint -> acute compression of spinal cord and/or vertebral arteries
The cerebellar hemispheres are responsible for motor planning & coordination of the ipsilateral extremities via their connections with the lateral descending motor systems. Consequently, cerebellar hemisphere lesions typically result in ipsilateral dysdiadochokinesia, limb dysmetria, and/ or intention tremor. 
In patients with HIV, CMV colitis is the second most common reactivation syndrome after CMV retinitis. Symptoms: Fever, anorexia, weight loss & abdominal pain. Colonoscopy shows mucosal erythema, erosions & ulcerations. Histology: acute & chronic inflammatory changes, vasculitis, giant cells with large, ovoid nuclei containing centralized intranuclear basophilic inclusions (Owl’s eye appearance). 
The HIV genome contains 3 major structural genes that are translated as polyproteins & subsequently cleaved by host protease (env gene products) or viral protease (gag-pol gene products) into the individual proteins that compose the HIV virus. Protease inhibitors block viral protease from cleaving gag-pol polyproteins, which results in the formation of immature virions that are noninfectious. 
Parvovirus B19 infection can. Cause transient aplastic crisis, particularly in those with underlying Hb disorders such as sickle cell anemia -> symptomatic anemia (exertional dyspnea, fatigue, low hematocrit, ejection murmur) due to inhibition of erythropoiesis and RBC maturation -> giant pronormoblasts with glassy, intranuclear viral inclusions

Asthma-Shortness of breath, chest tightness & cough. Tx: Rescue Inhaler, Albuterol which is a short acting beta agonist, an inhaled corticosteroid (e.g., mometasone), & a long acting beta agonist (e.g., salmeterol). For patients whose symptoms remain uncontrolled, adding an IgE-binding monoclonal antibody (e.g., omalizumab) may be beneficial. 
Omalizumab binds to the IgE antibody heavy chain & blocks the binding of IgE to the IgE receptors on mast cells. By preventing this binding, omalizumab inhibits proinflammatory substance release (including histamine & leukotrienes) by mast cells, markedly reducing airway inflammation. 
Calcium – sensing receptors are G-protein coupled receptors that regulate the secretion of parathyroid hormone in response to changes in circulating calcium levels. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a benign autosomal dominant disorder caused by defective calcium-sensing receptors in the parathyroid gland & kidneys. 
The most common site for Acute Compartment Syndrome is the Anterior Compartment of the left which includes the foot extensor muscles, anterior tibial artery, and the deep peroneal (fibular) nerve.

Ethylene glycol – vacuolar degeneration and ballooning of the PCT cells -> altered mental status, renal failure, high anion gap metabolic acidosis, increased osmolar gap, and calcium oxalate crystals in urine.
Combined hormonal contraceptives exhibit systemic effects by suppressing GnRH in the hypothalamus, which decreases synthesis of the gonadotropins FSH & LH in the anterior pituitary. Because an LH spike is required to stimulate ovulation, ovulation is inhibited. 
Bullous Impetigo – Blistering skin rash with tan to honey colored lesions. Infection by Staphylococcus aureus Bacteria, most common in young kids, contagious. Blistering is caused by production of exfoliative toxin A, a serine protease that targets desmoglein 1. Desmoglein is a cadherin component of desmosomes in the epidermal cellular junctions & causes a loss of cell adhesion. 
Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune disorder associated with antibodies against hemidesmosomes and is characterized by tense, subepidermal blisters. 
Peptidoglycan cell wall inhibitors, like penicillin, do not work on all Mycoplasma species (ureaplasma urealyticum) because they lack cell wall -> treat with antiribosomal agents (tetracyclines, macrolides)
Inhalant anesthetics will increase cerebral blood flow and increase intracranial pressure, as cerebral vascular resistance goes down. Reduced blood flow for heart, liver, lungs, and kidney.

The GI tract receives its blood supply from 3 main arteries: The Celiac Trunk, The SMA, The IVC. 
The Celiac trunk supplies the stomach, part of the duodenum, gallbladder, liver, spleen & pancreas. 
The SMA & IMA are 2 of the main vessels supplying the small & large intestines & are connected by a pair of anastomoses: the marginal artery of Drummond, which is the principal anastomosis, & the inconsistently present arc of Riolan (mesenteric meandering artery). These anastomoses protect the intestines from ischemia & due to the marginal artery, the IMA is not always reconnected during aortic aneurysm repair. 
The external iliac artery supplies the inferior epigastric artery & the deep circumflex iliac artery before becoming the femoral artery. Although the inferior epigastric artery anastomoses with the superior epigastric artery, these provide blood supply to the abdominal wall, not the intestines. 
The IVC has little role in the direct drainage of the intestines except from the rectum, which partially drains via the middle & inferior rectal veins into the intestinal veins. The remainder of the venous drainage occurs vis the superior & inferior mesenteric veins, which drain into the portal veins. 
After perfusing the liver, the portal vein drains into the IVC via the hepatic veins. 
The internal iliac artery supplies part of the rectum via the middle rectal artery. An anastomosis exists between the superior and middle rectal arteries, which can help prevent rectal ischemia after IMA occlusion. 
The SMA is more likely to prevent ischemia between the SMA & IMA 
Although the renal arteries arise from the abdominal aorta just inferior to the SMA, they do not provide collateral circulation to the intestines.

Rupture of Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysm is typically caused by systemic hypertension. This presents abruptly as unilateral weakness of the body and face, not a gradual-onset headache after a fall in an elderly patient. However, this would be an intraparenchymal hemorrhage that would appear as a hyperdensity within the brain, not in the subdural spaces.  
Subarachnoid hemorrhages present as a sudden, not gradual, severe headache with hyperdense regions within the basal cistern. They often coincide with nuchal rigidity and a fever and usually result from the rupture of an aneurysm located at the bifurcation of arteries within the circle of Willis.
Vertebrobasilar insufficiency may present as a decline in vision along with lightheadedness. CT would show hypodensity within the posterior brainstem and occipital lobe.

Subdural hemorrhages or hematomas result from the rupture of bridging veins (due to trauma or other underlying cause). They are especially common in elderly patients because of normal cortical atrophy that results in unsupported bridging veins susceptible to damage. Because venous bleeding is relatively slow, gradual progression of symptoms may be seen.

 Symptoms of constipation, extreme pain with defecation, and a sensitive perianal lump. These are all classic signs of external hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids are a normal part of the anal canal, where engorgement and straining from constipation results in prolapse of the tissue into the anal canal (forming a palpable lump).
External hemorrhoids originate below the pectinate line, whereas internal hemorrhoids originate above the pectinate line. 
In external hemorrhoids, the venous drainage of the tissue is from the inferior rectal vein, to the internal pudendal vein, to the internal iliac vein, to the common iliac vein, then to the inferior vena cava (IVC).
The superior rectal vein drains internal hemorrhoids, which are painless. Although the inferior rectal vein is the initial venous drainage for external hemorrhoids, it ultimately drains into the IVC and not the portal system. Similarly, although the internal pudendal vein is part of the external hemorrhoid drainage system, the final pathway is the IVC and not the portal system.

Management of SVT starts with identifying the abnormal rhythm on ECG and determining if the patient is hemodynamically stable. Initial conservative maneuvers such as carotid massage or valsalva maneuver can be performed; however, pharmacological treatment involves intravenous adenosine. 
One can differentiate prerenal from intrinsic renal failure on the basis of the fractional excretion of sodium FENa. A FENa ≤1% is indicative of prerenal causes, whereas a FENa ≥2% indicates intrinsic renal failure.
Methotrexate. Methotrexate is a chemotherapeutic agent associated with myelosuppression. It is an S phase-specific antimetabolite that acts as a folic acid analog and reversibly inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, interfering with nucleotide synthesis. Myelosuppression that is reversible with leucovorin (folinic acid). Leucovorin bypasses the block created by methotrexate by supplying folinic acid, the necessary factor for DNA synthesis, and allowing for bone marrow repletion.

If a patient who has had an ischemic stroke presents within 3 hours and has no contraindications, the standard treatment is tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Tissue plasminogen activator is secreted by endothelial cells and is the enzyme most directly responsible for degrading the fibrin matrix. Recombinant tPA (alteplase) and streptokinase are similar medications that are used to treat diseases in which fibrin clots prevent adequate blood flow to tissue, such as stroke, pulmonary embolus, and myocardial infarction.
Activation of antithrombin III is the mechanism of action of heparin, which is used as an anticoagulant in acute situations such as pulmonary embolisms or DVTs and acute coronary syndromes.

 Direct thrombin inhibitors, such as lepirudin and bivalirudin, are oral medications that can be used in the event of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
 A monoclonal antibody to GPIIb/IIIa (abciximab) inhibits platelet aggregation and is used in treatment of acute coronary syndromes.
Parathyroid adenoma causes an increased PTH level. The increased PTH results in hypercalcemia, which causes his variety of symptoms (kidney stones, pain in the bones, abdominal groans, and psychiatric overtones). The parathyroid glands secrete PTH, which helps regulate how the body uses calcium. PTH protects the serum ionized calcium concentration by increasing calcium levels and decreasing phosphate levels. PTH primarily acts on the bones, the gut, and the kidneys. It stimulates osteoclast activity and thus, bone resorption, releasing both calcium and phosphate. In the gut, PTH indirectly stimulates calcium absorption by the intestine by stimulating 1α-hydroxylase to produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-OH, the active form of vitamin D, also known as calcitriol). PTH acts on the kidneys by decreasing phosphate reabsorption (and therefore, increasing phosphate excretion). Overall, the net effect of PTH is increased free calcium and decreased phosphate, as calcium is increased via bone resorption and gut absorption, and phosphate is decreased through kidney excretion. 
PTH stimulates 1α-hydroxylase to convert 25-OH vitamin D to 1,25-OH vitamin D
PTH activates (rather than deactivates) 1α-hydroxylase. 
PTH does not increase calcium excretion by the kidneys; it increases calcium reabsorption by the kidneys. 
Calcium filtration decreases if the glomerular filtration rate is decreased,
"I 8 10 EGGs AAT 12": I 8 = IVC at T8; 10 EGGs = EsophaGus and vaGus at T10; and AAT 12 = Aorta, Azygos, and Thoracic duct at T12.
Bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa are commonly confused, as both can present with purging behavior (vomiting, excessive exercise, or some other type of compensatory behavior). Individuals who are obsessed with food and body weight and also practice restrictive eating are classified as having anorexia nervosa if their BMI <18.5 kg/m2 but are classified as having bulimia nervosa if their BMI >18.5 kg/m2.
Distention of this patient’s vessels in the upper limbs and face (“facial plethora”) and JVD are suggestive of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, likely resulting from a cancerous obstruction impairing the return of venous blood from the head, neck, and upper limbs to the heart

A patient presents with age-related macular degeneration treated with periodic injections in the eye. Ranibizumab, pegaptanib sodium, and aflibercept, the three FDA-approved injected treatments for exudative (wet) age-related neovascular macular degeneration (AMD), work by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Ranibizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds to VEGF, pegaptanib sodium is a pegylated anti-VEGF aptamer, and aflibercept binds to circulating VEGF and acts as a “VEGF trap.” They function by inhibiting new blood vessel growth, known as angiogenesis.
Like ranibizumab, bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody against VEGF that is used to treat several solid tumors, including colon, breast, and non-small cell lung cancers. It is given in combination with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin or irinotecan. The main adverse effects are hypertension and elevated risk of bleeding.

Pineal masses typically manifest with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting, as a result of obstruction of CSF flow by a space-occupying lesion. Pressure on the pretectal region of the midbrain may also result in Parinaud syndrome, a condition characterized by vertical gaze and pupil abnormalities.
A significant disadvantage of indirect-acting sympathomimetics lies in their ability to enter the central nervous system and produce undesirable stimulation because they are not specific for a particular receptor. Conversely, direct-acting sympathomimetics do not enter the CNS as readily, and they have more predictable effects due to their selective receptor-binding activity. As a result, direct-acting sympathomimetics can be used to modulate autonomic function less diffusely. 
Characteristic brownish cytoplasmic granules in both his heart and liver due to aging leading to death from brown atrophy of the heart -> due to lipofuscin. Lipofuscin is a non-degradable pigment composed of oxidized and polymerized membrane lipids, formed from organelles autophagocytosed by lysosomes.

Hydroxyurea acts as a ribonucleotide nuclease inhibitor, and it can cause bone marrow suppression. 
Imatinib is the current first-line agent used for treating CML, and its adverse effects include edema and lowered resistance to infection.
Microscopic evaluation of the stone is an important key to identifying the cause. A hexagonal shaped microscopic crystal is characteristic of cystinuria. Patients with cystinuria typically have increased levels of lysine and arginine in their urine due to a defect in amino acid reabsorption in the proximal tubule which leads to wasting of lysine, arginine, cystine, and ornithine. The elevated cystine level in the urine leads to recurrent stone formation. Treatment involves hydration and alkalization of the urine with acetazolamide.
Calcium stones – envelope or dumbbell shape
Ammonium magnesium phosphate (struvite) – coffin lid
Cystine – hexagonal
Uric acid stone – rhomboid or rosettes
Decreased platelets in the setting of a normal PT/PTT can be seen in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)
ITP:
Anti-GpIIb/IIIa antibodies → splenic consumption of platelet-antibody complex → decreased platelets and increased bleeding time. PT/aPTT not affected because coagulation cascade unaffected.
TTP:
ADAMTS13 mutation → vWF multimers → increased platelet adhesion → platelet thrombosis (thrombocytopenia). PT/aPTT not affected because coagulation cascade intact.
HUS:
Cytokine release from toxin → damage endothelium → microthrombi → platelet consumption. PT/aPTT normal because coagulation cascade unaffected.
This pattern is characteristic of a disorder like disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC):
DIC is characterized by widespread clotting/microthrombi formation which leads to a deficiency of clotting factors (increased PT/aPTT) and consumption of platelets (decreased platelet count, increased bleeding time). This condition can occur as a sequela of trauma, sepsis, or obstetric complication.
Hemophilia A or B
Hemophilia A and B are deficiencies of factor VIII and IX, respectively. Both of these factors are part of the intrinsic coagulation pathway and so deficiency leads to an increase in aPTT. Since PT only tests fidelity of the common or extrinsic pathway (I, II, V, VII, and X), it is unaffected in Hemophilia A or B. Platelet count would not be affected by either disorder as they only affect coagulation factors.
Normal aPTT with increased PT and decreased platelet count is not descriptive of any known disease process.  
Vitamin K is necessary for coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X. Because these coagulation factors are necessary for both the extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation cascade, a deficiency in vitamin K would lead to an increase in PT and aPPT. Notably, platelet count is unaffected as vitamin K deficiency only affects coagulation factors.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an extraintestinal complication of ulcerative colitis. About 70% of patients with PSC also have UC
Atropine is a nonselective muscarinic antagonist that prevents acetylcholine from binding to the muscarinic receptor. I
 Penicillin-induced autoimmune hemolytic anemia, an example of type II hypersensitivity. In this type of reaction, penicillin is believed to act as a hapten. On its own, a hapten molecule cannot elicit an immune response because it cannot activate helper T cells. However, when a hapten molecule binds to a protein, the hapten-protein conjugate is capable of eliciting an immune response.
Protein A, a cell wall protein that binds the Fc of human IgG, is present in the cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus, the most common cause of septic arthritis. However, H. influenzae does not have protein A as a virulence factor.
S. aureus and Escherichia coli produce alpha hemolysin, a toxin that destroys cell membranes of RBCs and WBCs (and leads to the characteristic clearing surrounding these bacteria on blood agar). E. coli can cause septic arthritis, but unlike H. influenzae, it is a gram-negative bacillus (not coccobacillus) and can grow on blood agar.
Hyaluronidase secreted by various bacteria including S. aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Clostridium perfringens, is not produced by H. influenzae species. Hyaluronidase functions to digest extracellular ground substance and allow for spread of the bacteria.
A type 3 secretion system, or T3SS, is a mechanism used by various organisms (Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli, Pseudomonas, Yersinia, and more) to aid in invasion or killing of host cells. None of these organisms are gram-negative coccobacilli which grow on chocolate agar but not blood agar.
H. influenzae is not known for its glycocalyx-enablingbiofilm production; organisms known to produce biofilm include Staphylococcus epidermidis (causing septic arthritis of artificial joints), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Exotoxin A is secreted by Pseudomonas and inhibits elongation factor 2 via ADP-ribosylation, thereby ceasing peptide production in the host cell. Diphtheria toxin has a similar mechanism of action. The primary virulence factor of H. influenzae is its capsule.
Fimbriae are attachment pili containing adhesins that aid in bacterial mucosal attachment. They are found in many bacteria including E. coli, Bordetella pertussis, S. aureus and S. pyogenes, and even in H. influenzae.  However, fimbriae are not the primary virulence factor of H. influenzae.

Hydroxyurea is commonly used in the treatment of myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, as well as sickle cell disease.
Activation of G-protein–coupled receptors in the adrenal cortex elevates cAMP levels and leads to increased production and secretion of corticosteroids. This describes the mechanism of hormones including ACTH, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and does not describe the biological mechanisms initiated by ectopic ADH production.
Activation of G-protein–coupled receptors in the hypothalamus results in elevated cAMP levels and inhibition of hypothalamic-induced thirst mechanism. This describes the hypothalamic mechanism of thirst, which takes place when ADH is produced under normal circumstances.
Activation of V2-receptors leads to a decrease in total peripheral resistance; activation of V1-receptors results in the concentration of urine.  
A presents with a murmur on auscultation that is loudest during S2. A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) can produce a continuous, machine-like murmur, like that heard in the audio clip. During normal development, the proximal part of the left sixth aortic arch becomes the proximal part of the left pulmonary arteries, and the distal part becomes the ductus arteriosus. The proximal part of the right 6th aortic arch forms the right pulmonary artery, and the distal part degenerates. 
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is very unlikely to occur in a 20-year-old patient; it typically occurs in older patients.
 Burkitt lymphoma -  It does occur in younger patients, but it typically presents with a fast-growing mass in the mandible or abdomen.
 Hairy cell leukemia typically presents in men in their fifties and sixties. Clinical signs and symptoms include massive splenomegaly, but lymph nodes are not typically affectet.  Hairy cell leukemia is typically associated with one or more cytopenia. 
A mutation in alanine aminotransferase would cause a defect in transamination of alanine and α-ketoglutarate into pyruvate and glutamate.

Maple Syrup Urine Diseases - poor feeding, irritability, and episodes of vomiting. Mutation in branched-chain alpha keto acid dehydrogenase -> accumulation of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Treatment is the elimination of valine, leucine, and isoleucine from the diet and thiamine supplementation. 
Bronchiectasis appears as a dilated bronchial tissue with necrotizing inflammation.Common causes of bronchiectasis include lung infections (eg, severe pneumonia, whooping cough, tuberculosis), fungal infections of the lung (eg, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis), and conditions that first damage the airways and then leave patients susceptible to infection (eg, cystic fibrosis and ciliary disorders such as Kartagener syndrome, chronic aspiration, and connective tissue diseases).
Caseating granulomas with central necrosis and Langhans giant cells are characteristic of secondary tuberculosis. In primary tuberculosis, imaging may reveal a Ghon complex, which involves hilar lymph nodes and a subpleural parenchymal lesion. In secondary tuberculosis, lesions are seen in the apical or posterior segments of the upper lobes. Another finding would be the presence of a cavitary lesion. None of these findings are observed on this patient’s chest CT.
Interdigitating areas of pink and red that form the "lines of Zahn" are characteristic of a thrombus, such as a pulmonary thromboembolism. These lines represent layers of RBCs, platelets, and fibrin as the thrombus forms. CT findings include visualization of the emboli and filling defects. Infarcted lung wedge segments may also be seen. This patient has none of these findings on chest CT.
Red-purple partial consolidation of parenchyma is seen in the congestive stage of lobar pneumonia. CT of the chest of a patient with lobar pneumonia would demonstrate diffuse opacities of the lung parenchyma, potentially in a lobular distribution. Other findings include dense consolidations and ground glass opacities. These findings are not seen on this patient’s CT image.
Small dark blue cells (Kulchitsky cells) represent a neuroendocrine neoplasm, such as a small cell carcinoma of the lung. On CT, lung cancer will often be seen as a distinct lung nodule, often with spiculations. No obvious signs of cancer can be seen on this patient’s CT scan.

Luminal narrowing >70% causes temporary cardiac ischemia without cell death, known as stable angina, in which the pain is relieved with rest
A deficiency of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. A deficiency in acetyl-CoA carboxylase causes a dysfunction in fatty acid synthesis, leading to poor growth, myopathy, and muscular hypotonia.
The rate-limiting step of fatty acid synthesis involves acetyl-CoA carboxylation via acetyl-CoA carboxylase + biotin cofactor to form malonyl-CoA, a substrate for fatty acid synthase. Malonyl-CoA is also an inhibitor of the carnitine shuttle, which transfers fatty acids into the mitochondria, thereby inhibiting the rate-limiting step of β-oxidation of fatty acids.
G3P and free fatty acids are the building blocks of triglycerides. 
Ketones are produced during fasting and starvation when the liver is undergoing high levels of fatty acid β-oxidation; they can be used by other organs as an energy source. 
Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate is a source of reducing power in the formation of fatty acids.
S-Adenosylmethionine is a methylation cofactor in a number of biochemical processes.
Anterior cerebral artery (ACA) infarcts produce contralateral cortical-type leg paresis and weakness, amnesia, and frontal lobe behavioral abnormalities. 
Right middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarcts typically involve aphasia, hemineglect, hemianopsia, and contralateral left-sided face-arm or face-arm-leg sensorimotor loss, depending on the regions of the MCA involved.
 Right posterior cerebral artery (PCA) infarcts often cause a left-sided homonymous hemianopsia, and may result in contralateral sensory loss, contralateral hemiparesis, or thalamic aphasia.
 Thrombosis of the basilar artery causes “locked-in syndrome,” where the patient is aware but cannot move or communicate, except by blinking. However, basilar artery infarctions usually involve its paramedian branches, leading to ischemia of the medial basis pontis and tegmentum, resulting in contralateral face-arm-leg weakness, dysarthria, or contralateral ataxia.
 Left anterior cerebral artery (ACA) infarcts produce right-sided cortical-type leg paresis and weakness, amnesia, and frontal lobe behavioral abnormalities.
 Left middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarcts typically involve aphasia, hemineglect, hemianopia, and right-sided face-arm or face-arm-leg sensorimotor loss.
 Left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) infarcts often cause a right-sided homonymous hemianopsia, and may result in contralateral sensory loss, contralateral hemiparesis, or thalamic aphasia.
 Long-term Treponema infection can destroy the vasa vasorum of the ascending aorta, leading to destruction and dilation of the vessel. The distorted aorta consequently affects the patency of the aortic valve. Treatment with penicillin is essential.
First-line therapy for patients with active TB includes isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Rifampin inhibits bacterial RNA synthesis by binding to the ß subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and blocking transcription. Rifampin has the classic benign side effect of turning bodily fluids orange or red.  
Isoniazid inhibits mycolic acid synthesis and causes peripheral neuropathy. 
Pyrazinamide inhibits the enzyme fatty acid synthetase I and can cause hepatotoxicity. 
Ethambutol inhibits arabinosyl transferase and can cause red-green color blindness. 
Second-line therapy for TB is streptomycin, which inhibits the 30S ribosomal subunit; it causes tinnitus, vertigo, ataxia, and nephrotoxicity. 
ACE inhibitors increase bradykinin, a vasodilator that can cause respiratory symptoms such as cough and angioedema. For this reason, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)are first-line treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors
ARBs (eg, losartan, candesartan, valsartan) act by blocking angiotensin II receptors. This inhibits the release of aldosterone, leading to volume contraction, as well as prevents constriction of the systemic vasculature. These mechanisms act to decrease blood pressure. Side effects include hyperkalemia and decreases in glomerular filtration rate. Additionally, ARBs are a known teratogen. They are first line in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (eg, diabetic nephropathy) in those intolerant to ACE inhibitors
ACE inhibitors (eg, captopril) prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to decreased circulating angiotensin II levels and subsequent decreases in aldosterone secretion and renal Na+ reabsorption. Renin and angiotensin I levels are increased.
Aldosterone receptor antagonists (eg, spironolactone, eplerenone) increase circulating renin, angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and aldosterone levels and decrease renal sodium reabsorption. Aldosterone receptor antagonists improve mortality when used to treat heart failure and are first line in the treatment of hepatic ascites.
β1-receptor blockers inhibit the secretion of renin from juxtaglomerular cells, causing decreases in circulating renin levels, those of all downstream renin-angiotensin-aldosterone products, and subsequently renal Na+ reabsorption.
Aldosterone receptor agonists would decrease circulating renin, angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and aldosterone levels, while renal Na+ reabsorption would be increased.
Initial treatment of AD involves acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which increase the amount of acetylcholine in the presynaptic space. Donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors often used for this purpose. Moderate-to-severe AD is an indication for memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. This drug blocks excitatory neurotoxicity, which is mediated by calcium influx, to prevent further neuronal damage.
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) functions to elevate serum calcium levels. PTH increases bone resorption, increases renal reabsorption of calcium, and decreases renal reabsorption of phosphate. This leads to a net effect of increased serum calcium levels and decreased serum phosphate levels.
Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) is secreted from squamous cell carcinomas (most commonly of the lung) and is considered evidence of a paraneoplastic syndrome. PTHrP acts like parathyroid hormone (PTH) to increase serum calcium levels by increasing bone resorption and renal reabsorption of calcium. PTHrP stimulates conversion of inactive 25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D to active 1,25-OH vitamin D, resulting in increased calcium and phosphate reabsorption in the intestines.
Thyroxine (T4), which is the prohormone of T3, is the major form of thyroid hormone secreted by the thyroid. Excess T4 occasionally causes mild hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia.
Vitamin D stimulates calcium and phosphate absorption from the intestine and increases bone resorption, resulting in increased serum calcium and phosphate levels. Excess vitamin D would result in hypercalcemia rather than hypocalcemia.
Damage the second-order preganglionic sympathetic neurons that pass through the inferior cervical or stellate ganglion and ascend to eventually synapse in the superior cervical ganglion. This results in Horner syndrome: unilateral ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis.
Cranial nerve II involvement would cause visual disturbances. 
Cranial nerve III involvement would result in dilation of the affected pupil.
First-order sympathetic involvement would occur due to a lesion at the level of the cervical spinal cord, upper thoracic spinal cord, or hypothalamus. 
Third-order sympathetic involvement would be implicated in injuries superior to the thoracic cavity, such as carotid dissection
Deficiency of propionyl-coA carboxylase (B7/biotin dependent) characteristic of propionic acidemia -> a seizure has elevated levels of odd-chain fatty acids, and increased anion gap, suggestive of a disorder affecting fatty acid metabolism. Undetectable levels of methylmalonic acid and elevated levels of propionyl coA. Propionic acidemia is an autosomal recessive disorder of metabolism of odd chain fatty acids and certain amino acids (methionine, valine, isoleucine, and threonine). These substrates cannot be converted to succinyl CoA and inserted into the Krebs cycle. Clinical signs are apparent within the first few days of life and include vomiting, poor feeding, hypotonia, hepatomegaly, seizures, and increased anion gap with concomitant metabolic acidosis. Treatment consists of a low-protein diet that is free of methionine, valine, isoleucine and threonine.
Methylmalonyl CoA mutase deficiency would result in a very similar presentation as the same pathway is interrupted; however, methylmalonic acid levels would be increased and propionic acid levels would be within normal range.
Medium chain acyl-coA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency results in elevated levels of odd and even medium chain fatty acids. However, MCAD presents with hypoglycemia.
Carnitine deficiency results in the toxic accumulation of long chain fatty acids, thus leading to a hypoketotic hypoglycemic state. Levels of propionic acid and methylmalonic acid would be normal.
Acetyl CoA Dehydrogenase deficiency results in the accumulation of fatty acyl CoA which leads to a hypoketotic hypoglycemic state. Levels of propionic acid and methylmalonic acid would be normal.
Peroxisome PEX gene mutation results in Zellweger syndrome. Accumulation of long chain fatty acids occurs in peroxisomes. This results in hepatic dysfunction, profound hypotonia, and difficulty feeding. Levels of propionic acid and methylmalonic acid would be normal.

A tender swollen right calf in the setting of a previous history of calf pain and family history of hypercoagulability is suggestive of a new deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Patient typically has no history of stasis (recent surgery, long drive or flight) or endothelial damage. Clue: sibling had an infarction of the mesenteric vein at a young age, this patient most likely has an inherited thrombophilia. The most common inherited thrombophilia in white individuals is factor V Leiden mutation
Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is an autoimmune cause of hypercoagulability thought to be precipitated by the inappropriate activation of coagulation factors. It is commonly characterized by recurrent venous thrombosis or frequent fetal loss, and it is confirmed by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and a prolonged partial thromboplastin time. However, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is acquired and would not be consistent with a family history of thrombotic events.
Infectious mononucleosis, a disease caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is a member of the herpesvirus family and is characterized by linear double-stranded enveloped DNA.

The bladder drains to external iliac nodes.
Becker muscular dystrophy. Becker muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a partially functioning dystrophin gene, resulting in muscular weakness and replacement of muscle with fatty tissue. The distribution of weakness can be similar to that of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, Duchenne muscular dystrophy presents in a younger age group, and its symptoms are more severe and progress much faster than those of Becker muscular dystrophy.

Phenoxybenzamine was originally studied as a treatment for BPH; however, it was replaced by more selective α1-adrenergic blockers. 
Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, which shows some efficacy in treating BPH, but is not FDA-approved for this indication.
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic neoplasm seen in older adults that is caused by a proliferation of myeloid lineage WBCs, as shown in this patient’s peripheral blood smear. CML is defined by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome [t(9,22)], which results in the production of the fusion protein, Bcr-Abl. Imatinib is a first-line treatment for CML, and a kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits the aberrant Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase by blocking its adenosine triphosphate-binding site. This inhibits the abnormal function of the fusion oncoprotein.

Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS1) deficiency is a rare urea cycle enzyme deficiency characterized by severe bouts of hyperammonemia and decreased to absent levels of citrulline. This defect will not result in elevated levels of orotic acid.
N-acetylglutamate synthetase deficiency symptoms mimic those of CPSI deficiency as N-acetylglutamate is an activator of CPSI.
Arginase is the urea cycle enzyme that converts arginine to urea and ornithine. Deficiency can lead to hyperammonemia and increased urinary excretion of orotic acid, but both symptoms are mild; however, hyperammonemia is rare and urinary excretion of orotic acid is not significant unlike in the patients with OTC defect.
Medium-chain acyl-coA dehydrogenase deficiency leads to impaired fatty acid breakdown which can present with symptoms of liver dysfunction and hyperammonemia. Accumulation of fatty acyl carnitines in the blood leads to hypoketotic hypoglycemia.

A penetrating wound to the chest can puncture the pleura, creating an opening for air to be sucked into the pleural space. With inspiration, the diaphragm descends, lowering the intrapleural pressure. If there is communication directly between the pleural space and the outside world, air is sucked into this negative pressure space and collapses the lung. Pneumothorax is seen on x-ray of the chest as a collapsed lung.
A hemothorax would cause dullness, rather than hyperresonance on percussion, and blood would be leaking out of the chest wound.
In a vasectomy, the ductus deferens, the tube that transports sperm from the epididymis to the ejaculatory duct, is specifically targeted to achieve results. This structure is tied in two places and transected. The patient’s ability to produce sperm is unchanged, but transection of the ductus deferens prevents the normal path of the sperm and results in permanent birth control.

The uterus, uterine tubes, cervix and superior third of the vagina is derived from the paramesonephric ducts. In males, this structure is lost.
MAOIs prevent the metabolism of all monoamines, including tyramine. This triggers the release of catecholamine stores and further potentiates the pressor effects of high doses of sympathetic amines. Tyramine itself is a vasoactive compound. When tyramine is consumed by a patient who is concurrently taking an MAOI, it is not adequately metabolized, and its vasoactivity can cause a drastic increase in blood pressure and a hypertensive crisis. A person taking an MAOI is also at increased risk of hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome if taken with meperidine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or some tricyclic antidepressants.

An inhibitor of mast cell mediator release, such as cromolyn, is used for asthma prophylaxis
Steroids, which inhibit cytokine synthesis, are used to treat both acute and chronic asthma
Theophylline inhibits phosphodiesterase enzyme and adenosine receptors, and therefore provides bronchodilation of the airway
SVT – Vagal Massage. Carotid sinus massage stimulates the firing of baroreceptors, which then synapse in the medulla, leading to autonomic changes. An increase in firing of these receptors leads to a decrease in heart rate via slowed conduction through both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes as a result of an increase in parasympathetic activity.

Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), which can be effective for the treatment of atypical depression and anxiety. However, MAOIs are not first-line treatments for social anxiety disorder due to extensive side effects and the possibility of severe adverse outcomes, such as hypertensive crisis. MAOIs are contraindicated in patients taking serotonin-modulating antidepressants and some over-the-counter cold medications (eg, dextromethorphan), which when taken concurrently with MAOIs, may result in serotonin syndrome.
Esmolol is a cardioselective β-blocker that works specifically by blocking β1-receptors in the heart, thereby decreasing the rate and force of cardiac contractions. It would be effective in treating this patient’s palpitations, but this β-blocker is not indicated as first-line treatment for social anxiety disorder.
Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) medication typically reserved for patients with major depression who have failed first-line therapy (ie, SSRIs). Other indications for TCAs include peripheral neuropathy, chronic pain, and migraine prophylaxis. TCAs have a wide variety of adverse side effects, including Convulsions, Coma and Cardiotoxicity. Therefore, a TCA like amitriptyline is not the first-line treatment of choice for social anxiety disorder.
Epinephrine is an agonist at α1-, α2-, β1-, and β2-receptors with β > α effect. Phentolamineis a reversible antagonist at α1- and α2-receptors. Administration of phentolamine would reduce the blood pressure because it blocks α1-receptors.
Acetylcholine and isoproterenol - because when either acetylcholine or isoproterenol is administered alone, it would decrease the blood pressure.
When norepinephrine is administered, it would stimulate only α-receptors after administration of propranolol. The result would be vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure.

Autosomal dominant hereditary spherocytosis is a type of Coombs-negative immune hemolytic anemia caused by dysfunctional RBC structural membrane proteins. While is is associated with spherocytes on peripheral blood smear, it is also associated with an increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC).
Bone marrow infiltration by neoplastic cells most often occurs in the setting of an underlying malignancy. The absence of lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly in this patient makes a neoplastic process less likely.
Lyme disease is associated with migratory arthralgias, but it is typically not characterized by nephritis and cytopenias. 
Destruction of RBCs by a parasite, such as in babesiosis or malaria, can be associated with hemolytic anemia. Each of these organisms would show characteristic RBC inclusions on the peripheral blood smear.

These patients can have associated hemolytic anemia secondary to destruction of RBCs (which are unstable secondary to the build-up of hemoglobin molecules made with 4 beta globin proteins)
Anemia of chronic disease is caused by sequestration of iron by the immune system. While anemia of chronic disease is actually the most common form of anemia in SLE, this patient’s peripheral blood smear showing spherocytes in the setting of an increased reticulocyte count suggests a hemolytic process.

 An alternative to chlorpromazine is clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia. It is less likely to cause the tardive dyskinesia associated with typical antipsychotics, such as chlorpromazine, since it does not block dopamine 2 (D2) receptors as strongly. Further support that the patient was switched to clozapine is his low WBC count; drug-induced agranulocytosis is a known side effect of clozapine and requires regular blood testing. Other side effects of clozapine include mouth and throat ulcers, myocarditis, weight gain, and sialorrhea. Because of its side effects and the need to test the patient’s blood regularly, clozapine is considered a medication of last resort in refractory or severe cases of schizophrenia.
Li-Fraumeni syndrome is characterized by an autosomal dominant mutation in TP53 that is associated with multiple malignancies at an early age. Commonly-associated malignancies can be remembered with the mnemonic SBLA cancer syndrome: Sarcoma, Breast, Leukemia, and Adrenal gland cancers. In Li-Fraumeni syndrome, one abnormal copy of TP53 is inherited, leading to heterozygosity of p53.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Patients with one or more elements of the Virchow triad (local trauma to the vessel wall, stasis, and hypercoagulability) are at increased risk for developing DVT. Thromboxane A2, produced by platelets, stimulates platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction and is elevated at the site of a forming clot. Thromboxane A2 also acts as an amplification signal for more potent platelet agonists, such as thrombin. Elevation of thromboxane A2 levels is a step in the signaling cascade that results in formation of a clot.
Prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) inhibits platelet aggregation, causes relaxation of smooth muscle, reduces systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance by direct vasodilation, and causes natriuresis in the kidneys.

 Surface ectoderm gives rise to the adenohypophysis, lens of the eye, epidermis, and the epithelial linings of the skin, ear, eye, and nose.
Painful upper extremity rash, malnutrition, diarrhea, and mental status changes. Individuals who are homeless or affected by alcohol use disorder are at risk for developing dietary vitamin deficiencies. Based on his symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency, also called pellagra. 
Because niacin is derived from tryptophan, a decrease in tryptophan absorption or an increase in tryptophan metabolism can produce similar symptoms
β-Blockers cause cardiac vasoconstriction, not vasodilation. Also, they decrease contractility, decrease cardiac output, and decrease the heart rate.
Aseptic (culture-negative) or viral meningitis - single stranded positive sense RNA viruses without an envelope (naked). 
A patient with meningitis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (typically only seen in miliary tuberculosis), an acid fast bacteria, would have similar lab values to those seen in this case, however, this child had no history of recent travel to areas where TB is prevalent and is otherwise healthy.
Infection with arbovirus, an enveloped positive sense ssRNA, is seen in all age groups; however symptoms are more severe in the elderly and immunocompromised. Arboviruses are transmitted via blood transfusions and mosquito vectors; birds and horses are also hosts. Meningitis that is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, a gram-positive diplococcus, manifests with much more severe symptoms than are seen in this patient. Laboratory values would show a predominance of polymorphonuclear neutrophils as opposed to lymphocytes. Glucose would also be decreased.
Meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis, a gram-negative diplococcus, is more often seen in teens/young adults in tight quarters (e.g., on college campuses). It is a more severe form of meningitis than is seen in this patient, with labs that would be similar to S. pneumoniae.
Infection with HSV-2, an enveloped double-stranded DNA with glycoprotein, would be more pronounced in the early days of life and causes a very severe form of meningoencephalitis (as opposed to meningitis).
Borreliosis, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, a spirochete transmitted by ticks, would yield similar laboratory concentrations (elevated lymphocytes, normal glucose) to those associated with viral infection and meningitis. 
CMV is part of a group of microbes that cause ToRCHeS infections, alongside Toxoplasma gondii, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, HIV, Herpes simplex virus-2, and Syphilis. Most ToRCHeS infections are transmitted from mother to fetus transplacentally; however, transmission during delivery (particularly with herpes simplex virus-2) is also possible in some cases. Any ToRCHeS infection can result in hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, thrombocytopenia (petechial skin rash), and growth retardation.
Congenitally acquired rubella is associated with cataracts, hearing loss, and congenital heart disease.
Congenitally acquired herpes simplex virus is associated with neonatal meningoencephalitis and vesicular, herpetic lesions.
Congenitally acquired HIV presents as recurrent infections and chronic diarrhea in neonates.
Congenitally acquired syphilis often results in stillbirth and hydrops fetalis. If the infant survives, he or she will have notched teeth, a saddle nose, saber shins, and sensorineural deafness.
Thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, are oral hypoglycemic agents that increase peripheral sensitivity to insulin by binding to and stimulating the activity of nuclear transcription factors called peroxisome proliferator–activated receptors. This decreases blood glucose levels. Thiazolidinediones also decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis.
Insulin binds to the insulin receptor that has tyrosine kinase activity. The most important adverse effects of insulin are hypoglycemia and injection site reactions. Sodium-dependent glucose transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors such as canagliflozin are not safe to prescribe for patients with renal disease. SGLT-2 inhibitors block the reabsorption of glucose in the kidney. Major adverse effects include urinary tract infections, kidney injury, and hypotension. 
Delayed hydrolysis of sugars and absorption of glucose is the mechanism of action of α-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose. Sulfonylureas, such as glyburide, tolbutamide, and glipizide, work by closing potassium channels in the β-cell membrane, resulting in depolarization and calcium influx, thereby triggering the release of insulin.
If it starts with 1 (17, 11) they have hypertension & if ends in 1, then they have virilization (in females. 21 & 11). 
Low levels of angiotensin II produces an increase in GFR by preferentially constricting efferent arterioles, while high levels of angiotensin II produces a decrease in GFR by constricting both the afferent and efferent arterioles.
Tumor cells survived initial therapy because of mutations that altered the drug target.
Medication-induced hemolytic anemia -> glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Exposure to oxidant drugs (eg, antimalarial drugs) or infections (eg, hepatitis A) -> production of peroxides and free radicals. Normally quickly inactivated by reduced glutathione (GSH). GSH is then replenished via glutathione reductase, which requires reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). G6PD regenerates NADPH from NADP+. As such, the regeneration of GSH is impaired in G6PD-deficient individuals, and the peroxides and free radicals accumulate -> denaturation of hemoglobin -> formation of methemoglobin and denatured globin that attach to the RBC membranes (aka Heinz bodies) -> destruction by reticuloendothelial macrophages.
ACE inhibitors  like lisinopril inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which  causes peripheral vasodilation, lowering blood pressure. They also cause dilation of both the afferent and efferent arterioles, with preference to the efferent arteriole dilation
Germline mosaicism is a mutation in the egg or sperm cells, where half of the gametes carry the mutation and the other half do not. Germline mutations will not present phenotypically in the carrier of the gametes but instead will be passed on and expressed in their offspring. Therefore, the patient presents with symptoms of the disorder but the parents do not. Eg: 3-year-old patient is diagnosed with a right midshaft humeral fracture after a minor fall. This is one of many fractures that he has had since birth and he also has blue sclerae. Neither parent has ever sustained a fracture, but an older son had similar symptoms when he was younger. This depicts a classic presentation of osteogenesis imperfecta in both children due to germline mosaicism. 
De novo mutation would be seen in conditions such as achondroplasia and only present in one child. 
Heteroplasmy would be seen in genetic diseases passed down from the mother such as MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes); the mother and all of her offspring would have some form of the genetic disease. 
Somatic mosaicism is a mutation that arises from mitotic errors after fertilization during embryogenesis and is observed in cancer and in skin mosaicism. 
The main therapies used to prevent diabetic nephropathy are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (eg, losartan). These drugs act by dilating the efferent arteriole, which can help to decrease the intraglomerular pressure and prevent further progression of albuminuria.
Malaise, headaches, fever, chills, and a nonproductive cough—in combination with fluffy bilateral infiltrates seen on a chest x-ray—are highly suggestive of an atypical pneumonia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the most common causes of atypical pneumonia
Macrolide antibiotics, such as azithromycin, are the first-line treatment for M. pneumoniaeinfection. These drugs bind to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, thus impairing the elongation of peptide chains and ultimately causing a premature termination of translation. 
M. pneumoniae has no cell wall, so it is not sensitive to the penicillins or cephalosporins, which work by blocking the transpeptidase cross-linkage of bacterial cell walls. 
Metronidazole works by forming free radical toxic metabolites that damage bacterial cell DNA and is effective against microbes that do not cause respiratory symptoms. 
Rifamycins work by inhibiting DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and are used in the prophylaxis of bacterial meningitis.
Isoniazid inhibits mycolic acid synthesis and is used in the treatment of tuberculosis.
I cells, responsible for secreting cholecystokinin, would lead to increased pancreatic secretions and digestive function but would not result in ulcers.
Mucous cells function to protect the stomach lining from excess acid and would be protective against ulcers.
Chief cells and parietal cells may indirectly increase acid production to ultimately exacerbate this patient's pain. However, increased acid production is not the primary mechanism or direct cause of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
Gastrin is normally produced in the G cells of the stomach.
Ranitidine belongs to the class of drugs termed H2-receptor antagonists. Other H2-receptor antagonists include famotidine and cimetidine. They bind to H2-receptors on parietal cells to block the receptors' interaction with histamine. H2-receptors are coupled via a Gs regulatory protein to adenylate cyclase and stimulate cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) formation, meaning that H2-receptors are Gs-coupled receptors. Therefore blockage of H2-receptors means that Gs-coupled receptors have been inhibited
Proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, pantoprazole, and lansoprazole bind to and inhibit the H+/K+ ATPase pump on parietal cells.
 Anticholinergics such as atropine bind to the muscarinic M3-receptor.
 Prostaglandins bind to the prostaglandin receptor
 Somatostatin analogs such as octreotide bind to the somatostatin receptor.
The muscles of facial expression and the facial nerve (CN VII) are derived from the second branchial (pharyngeal) arch. The second arch also gives rise to the posterior belly of the digastric, the platysma, the stylohyoid, and the stapedius muscles.
The first branchial arch gives rise to the muscles of mastication, the mylohyoid, the anterior belly of the digastric muscle, the tensor veli palatini, and the tensor tympani. These muscles are innervated by the mandibular branch of CN V.
The third branchial pouch gives rise to the inferior parathyroid glands and the thymus. Abnormalities in the pharyngeal pouches are seen in in DiGeorge syndrome.
The fourth branchial pouch gives rise to the superior parathyroid glands. Abnormalities in the pharyngeal pouches are also seen in DiGeorge syndrome.
The thyroglossal duct connects the thyroid diverticulum with the tongue in the embryo but is obliterated during development. Its only remnant in the adult is the foramen cecum.
Treatment for children with ALL involves several phases, including induction, consolidation, maintenance, and CNS prophylaxis. Induction therapy is accomplished by a four-drug regimen that includes (1) a steroid (commonly prednisone or dexamethasone), (2) asparaginase, (3) doxorubicin/daunorubicin, and (4) vincristine. 
Vincristine and vinblastine are plant alkaloid derivatives that act on cells specifically during the M phase of the cell cycle. They bind to tubulin and block polymerization of microtubules, preventing mitotic spindle assembly and promoting cell cycle arrest in M phase.
Doxorubicin is another chemotherapeutic agent commonly used in the initial stage of ALL treatment. It inhibits DNA synthesis through the generation of free radicals that cause strand breaks. It also has the ability to intercalate (insert) between DNA base pairs, and therefore acts during multiple phases of the cell cycle but not during M phase. 
Methotrexate has a variety of indications and blocks DNA synthesis during S phase. Later in S phase and early in G2 phase. 
Etoposide inhibits topoisomerase II. 
Cisplatin is not cell-cycle specific and is more commonly used to treat adult cancers.
Appropriate drug treatment of a non–ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI) in the emergency department includes aspirin, anticoagulants, ADP receptor inhibitors, β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and analgesia (eg, morphine, nitroglycerin). Patients with an ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) should also undergo reperfusion therapy with either fibrinolytics or (preferred) percutaneous coronary intervention. β-Blockers are part of the gold standard treatment for MI, but they, especially the nonselective ones, are absolutely contraindicated for this patient because administration in the context of recent cocaine use would result in unopposed alpha effects. By blocking presynaptic reuptake of norepinephrine and increasing release of catecholamines from the adrenal glands, cocaine results in a high degree of adrenergic activity. β-blockers block the β2 receptors which normally vasodilate the arteries. Without this effect, the adrenergic activity isolate the effects of α-receptors, in particular serving as an α1-agonist that increases vascular smooth muscle contraction. An increase in vascular constriction would cause an increase in hypertension and further ischemia in the coronary arteries. Therefore treatment with a β-blocker should be avoided as this would result in unopposed α-adrenergic effects.
Donepezil (a cholinesterase inhibitor/indirect cholinomimetic) may improve cognitive measures by increasing the amount of available acetylcholine at the synapse. 
Dandy-Walker syndrome is a congenital noncommunicating hydrocephalus typically associated with a cluster of abnormal findings that include abnormal formation of the cerebellar vermis. This condition leads to obstruction of the outlet foramina of Luschka and Magendie. The MRI would reveal a largely absent cavity in place of the cerebellum, and clinically the patient would have symptoms present in infancy.
Lateral medullary syndrome, or Wallenberg syndrome, usually occurs as a result of occlusion of one of the posteroinferior cerebellar arteries (PICA). It manifests with loss of pain and temperature sensations over the contralateral side of the body and the ipsilateral face. 
Statins (eg, atorvastatin) work by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme required for the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. This consequently causes an upregulation of liver LDL receptors and a subsequent increase in LDL uptake. The result is a marked decrease in circulating LDL and total cholesterol concentrations. Side effects include hepatotoxicity (for which liver function must be monitored) and myopathy (particularly when combined with a fibrate or niacin). 
Fibrates (eg, gemfibrozil) upregulate lipoprotein lipase and have profound triglyceride-lowering properties. They also activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) to induce HDL synthesis. In patients with very high triglyceride concentrations, fibrates are used to prevent the development of pancreatitis. They are not first line for preventing adverse cardiovascular outcomes in peripheral vascular disease or cardiovascular disease.
Bile acid resins (eg, cholestyramine) prevent the intestinal reabsorption of bile acids, forcing the liver to use cholesterol in its replenishment. They are not as effective as statins in lowering LDL cholesterol.
Niacin inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue, thereby reducing hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis. Niacin is most effective in raising HDL cholesterol, which has not been proven to improve cardiovascular disease outcomes. Because of its side effect profile, niacin is generally used only in dyslipidemia that is refractory to treatment with other lipid-lowering agents.
Ezetimibe prevents cholesterol absorption at the small intestine brush border. It is inferior to statins both in lowering LDL cholesterol and preventing adverse cardiovascular outcomes, but it may be used in patients who have experienced adverse effects from statin therapy.
Arthritis associated with an autoimmune disease, such as lupus, would present with findings of glomerulonephritis on biopsy (and likely blood in urine).  
Sensorineural hearing loss is associated with Alport syndrome, which presents with basement membrane splitting on a kidney biopsy specimen along with a positive family history. 
Hemoptysis with kidney disease is key to Goodpasture syndrome, but a renal biopsy specimen from a patient with Goodpasture syndrome would demonstrate a linear IgG pattern with immunofluorescence. 
Pharyngitis associated with group A β-hemolytic strep is typically accompanied by the presence of blood in the urine
Type IV collagen defects are seen in Alport syndrome, an X-linked dominant disorder that presents with eye problems, glomerulonephritis, and sensorineural deafness.
Type II collagen is found in cartilage, the vitreous body, and the nucleus pulposus. Defects in type II collagen can cause Kniest dysplasia, which leads to disproportionately short stature, and Stickler syndrome, which results in hereditary ophthalmoarthropathy and deafness.
Fibrillin defects are seen in Marfan syndrome, an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by tall stature with arachnodactyly, cystic medial necrosis of the aorta, a floppy mitral valve, and lens subluxation.
Type 1 collagen defects lead to osteogenesis imperfecta, an autosomal-dominant disorder that presents with multiple bone fractures, blue sclerae, tooth abnormalities, and hearing loss. 
Phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine are the nonselective α-adrenergic blockers used in the preoperative management of pheochromocytomas. Phenoxybenzamine is an irreversible, nonselective agent with a longer duration of action than phentolamine and is used preferentially to control blood pressure and arrhythmias.
 Phenelzine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, is used to treat depression, and is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma.
 Phentolamine is a short-acting, nonselective α-antagonist. Although it may be used in the treatment of pheochromocytoma, its shorter duration of action makes it a better choice for treating acute hypertensive crisis.
Phenylephrine, an α-agonist, would not be appropriate for the treatment of pheochromocytomas because it would actually worsen the patient’s hypertension via its sympathomimetic effect on α1-receptors, causing vasoconstriction and increased vascular tone.
Propranolol, a nonselective β-blocker, can be used in the management of hypertension, since it blocks the action of epinephrine and norepinephrine at both β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. However, initiating a β-blocker prematurely before adequate α-blockade would cause unopposed α-adrenergic receptor stimulation, precipitating a hypertensive crisis.
Patient with progressively worsening headaches on the right side of her head, and head pain the increases when she gets out of bed in the morning. An MRI reveals a tumor attached to the dura mater, and excisional biopsy shows that the tumor arises from the arachnoid. The MRI and clinical symptoms of headache and focal neurologic defects are consistent with a tumor that forms on the meninges, called a meningioma. A tumor common in middle-aged women, and is the most common tumor affecting the central nervous system. Psammoma bodies representing round microscopic calcific collections, are a feature of the psammomatous variant of meningioma.
Oligodendrogliomas are characterized by cells with a “fried egg” appearance, due to the presence of dark nuclei within a small amount of cytoplasm. 
Ependymomas demonstrate perivascular pseudorosettes that represent round-to-oval nuclei and long, delicate processes around vessels. 
Glioblastoma multiforme cells have a pseudopalisading appearance.

Pineal gland, pinealoma- compression of Cerebral aquaduct.
Medulloblastomas are indicated by hyperchromatic nuclei with scant cytoplasm, appearing as small blue cells.
6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) & Methotrexate disrupt the S phase of the cell cycle. 6-MP is a purine analog that is taken up into DNA during the S phase, halting DNA synthesis and leading to cell death. Its adverse effects include bone marrow, GI, and liver toxicities.
Bleomycin and doxorubicin are antitumor antibiotics; bleomycin has the greatest affect on the G2 phase, whereas doxorubicin’s actions are not specific to a particular cell cycle phase. 
Paclitaxel and vincristine are microtubule inhibitors and both act in the M phase of the cell cycle.
Influenza is a orthomyxovirus that is enveloped, segmented and contains negative-sense, single-stranded RNA. It contains hemagglutinin, which binds sialic acid promoting viral entry, and neuraminidase, which promotes progeny virion release. Tx: oseltamivir
Enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus describes the family of herpesviruses, which generally do not cause gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. 
Enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA with a helical capsid describes coronavirus, which is responsible for the common cold; this virus causes upper respiratory symptoms and occasionally GI symptoms. 
Non-enveloped, non-segmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA describes rhinovirus, which can cause symptoms of the common cold; however, a fever is not usually associated with adult illness caused by rhinovirus. 
Non-enveloped, segmented, double-stranded RNA viruses characterize reoviruses, which are associated with GI symptoms, but typically do not involve the respiratory tract. None of these virus families are associated with secondary bacterial pneumonia.
Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with a rapid rate and irregularly shaped P waves. Treat with verapamil, a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker commonly used for short-term management of SVT. By inhibiting the voltage-dependent calcium channels in cardiac pacemaker cells and slowing the rate of recovery, diltiazem will decrease the rate at which impulses generated by ectopic foci in the atria are transmitted through the atrioventricular (AV) node. As a result, the PR interval will be prolonged, and the ventricles will be protected from rapid successions of impulses generated from the ectopic atrial foci, making this medication useful for preventing nodal arrhythmias. Diltiazem blocks L-type calcium channels in cardiac myocytes (including cardiac cells that comprise the heart's conduction system). 
An increase in the speed of AV node conduction would be dangerous for a patient with AF because this would cause the ventricles to fire at an even faster rate. Although diltiazem does have some effect on vascular smooth muscle, it has more of an effect on the heart (while verapamil has even less of an effect on vascular smooth muscle). Also, what little effect it does have is to decrease vascular resistance, lowering blood pressure and resulting in atrial tachycardia, which would, again, be dangerous for a patient with AF. Although prolongation of the QT interval (prolonged ventricular depolarization) would be beneficial because it would prolong the refractory period of the ventricles, thus helping to protect it 
Hunter syndrome. This  syndrome is an X-linked disorder caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme iduronate sulfatase. In patients with Hunter syndrome, pearly, papular skin eruptions are usually first seen around the scapulae but then spread to involve the trunk and upper thighs. 
Clinically, Hunter syndrome is very similar to Hurler syndrome. Both disorders are mucopolysaccharidoses that are characterized by an accumulation of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. However, Hunter syndrome is notable for the absence of corneal clouding, which is present in Hurler syndrome. Moreover, symptoms of Hunter syndrome manifest between 2 and 4 years of age, while Hurler syndrome is generally diagnosed in the first year of life.
A deficiency in α-L-iduronidase causes Hurler syndrome. Among other signs and symptoms, patients with Hurler syndrome have characteristic corneal clouding, which is absent in patients with Hunter syndrome.
β-Glucosidase deficiency and sphingomyelinase deficiency are responsible for Gaucher disease and Niemann-Pick disease, respectively. Gaucher disease and Niemann-Pick disease are sphingolipidosis diseases that are not associated with coarse facies, and both present with hepatomegaly and neurologic defects.
A deficiency in α-galactosidase A is seen in Fabry disease. Patients with Fabry disease exhibit peripheral neuropathy, angiokeratomas, and hypohidrosis.
Hexosaminidase A deficiency is responsible for Tay-Sachs disease. Patients with Tay-Sachs disease have progressive neurodegenerative delay and the classic “cherry-red” spot on the macula.
Because fibroids are estrogen sensitive, they tend to increase in size during menses or pregnancy and decrease in size after menopause. This patient presents with heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), bleeding between periods, and an asymmetrically enlarged uterus. The pathology slide shows a monotonous population of spindled cells with blunt-ended, "cigar-shaped" nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. The cells are arranged in intersecting fascicles causing the nuclei to stream like a school of fish—the classic presentation and microscopic description of a fibroid or leiomyoma. Fibroids are common smooth muscle tumors that usually manifest with multiple masses. 
A mass that enlarges after menopause would be suggestive of uterine or endometrial cancer. 
Formation of chocolate cysts is associated with endometriosis. Endometriosis usually presents with dyspareunia, dyschezia, and palpable, tender nodularity, which this patient does not have. 
Pelvic inflammatory disease commonly presents with odiferous vaginal discharge, pain with sexual intercourse, and urinary symptoms, as well as a history of multiple unprotected sexual encounters.
systemic mycoses, specifically Blastomycosis, which occurs after inhalation of the dimorphic fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis. The pathogen is endemic to the Midwest regions of the United States, including the Great Lakes. Biopsy specimen of affected areas shows the characteristic yeast, which is thick walled and spherical, producing single buds with a broad base of attachment. Blastomycosis often presents with flu-like symptoms, fevers, chills, cough, and pleuritic chest pain. Moderate pulmonary disease and mild disseminated disease, as seen in this patient, may be treated with oral itraconazole. Severe pulmonary disease, moderate disseminated disease, and disease in immunocompromised patients may be treated with intravenous amphotericin B.


The finding of oval yeast cells within macrophages is typical of histoplasmosis, which is also endemic to the Midwest United States and causes pulmonary disease. 
The finding of thick-walled spherules filled with endospores is typical of coccidioidomycosis, a systemic mycosis that is endemic to the Southwestern United States. Coccidioidomycosis mostly causes pulmonary infection. 
The finding of budding yeast with “captain’s wheel” formation (cells covered in budding blastoconidia) is characteristic of paracoccidioidomycosis, a systemic mycosis that is endemic to Latin America
The finding of strands and spores with “spaghetti and meatballs” appearance is typical of tinea versicolor, a cutaneous mycosis caused by Malassezia species. Affected patients have a fungal infection limited to the skin; hypopigmented patches are common. 
Patient presents with diarrhea, a heart murmur, and valvular disease. Testing reveals the heart murmur is secondary to a neoplasm. This should raise suspicions for serotonin syndrome, secondary to a carcinoid tumor. Serotonin is secreted by carcinoid tumors, and causes symptoms of flushing, watery diarrhea, and right-sided valvular dysfunction.5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) is a metabolite of serotonin that can be measured in a 24-hour urine collection. Suspect intravenous drug use or carcinoid syndrome when there is any pathology exclusively involving right-sided valves. Serotonin is metabolized in the lung vasculature, leaving left-sided valves unaffected.
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a tumor marker for hepatocellular carcinoma and gonadal germ cell tumors. 
Cancer antigen-125 (CA 125) is a tumor marker used to monitor the response to treatment, and detect recurrence of ovarian cancer.
 Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) is utilized to monitor treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 
Carcinoembryonic antigen is a nonspecific tumor marker that is often seen in colorectal and pancreatic cancers.
Parkinson is a degenerative disease of the substantia nigra. There is a depletion of dopamine in the substantia nigra pars compacta. This is due to a loss of melanin-containing dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. 
Huntington disease caused by a defect in the Huntington (HTT) gene that leads to a trinucleotide repeat expansion of the ‘CAG’ sequence. Neurodegeneration is seen in the striatum, which includes both the caudate and putamen. This leads to a loss of GABAergic neurons. Upon neurological imaging, the lateral ventricles may appear enlarged. 
Alzheimer disease is the most common cause of dementia. It is caused by degeneration of the prefrontal cortex, leading to global loss of cognitive ability. There are no focal neurological deficits. Alzheimer disease is characterized by loss of acetylcholine, due to deficiency of choline acetyltransferase. This loss is most prominent in the basal nucleus of Meynert and the hippocampus.
The lentiform nucleus, or lenticular nucleus, comprises the putamen and the globus pallidus within the basal ganglia. 
Copper deposition in the lentiform nucleus leads to toxicity, seen in Wilson disease. Symptoms include dysarthria, dystonia, tremor, parkinsonism, liver disease, psychiatric disease, Kayser-Fleischer rings, hemolytic anemia, and renal disease. Hemiballism affects the contralateral subthalamic nucleus. 
Paramyxoviruses have an envelope and a helical capsid. They are single-stranded, negative-sense, linear, nonsegmented RNA viruses.
Reoviruses contain double-stranded, linear RNA, and caliciviruses contain single-stranded, positive-sense, linear, nonsegmented RNA. Both reoviruses and caliciviruses can cause diarrhea, but not croup. 
Delta virus (hepatitis D virus) is a single-stranded, negative-sense, circular RNA virus that worsens hepatitis B infections. 
Orthomyxoviruses are single-stranded, negative-sense, linear, segmented RNA viruses, such as the influenza virus, which can cause chills, muscle aches, runny nose, headaches, and fatigue in addition to congestion, cough, and fever.
Patient presents with a severe pounding headache and vomiting. CT scan shows an intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH). Spontaneous (ie, nontraumatic) IPH occurs most commonly in middle to late adult life, and is most commonly caused by systemic hypertension. IPH may also be seen with amyloid angiopathy, recurrent lobar hemorrhagic strokes in the elderly, vasculitis, and neoplasms.

Rupture of a small intraparenchymal vessels can result in hemorrhage within the brain, and is often associated with onset of neurologic symptoms. Symptoms of IPH usually appear suddenly. They include headache, weakness, confusion, and ipsilateral paralysis. The buildup of blood puts pressure on the brain and interferes with its oxygen supply, which can quickly cause brain and nerve damage.

Intraparenchymal hemorrhages are a type of hemorrhagic stroke. Hemorrhagic strokes occur when a brain aneurysm bursts, or a weakened blood vessel leaks. The blood spills into or around the brain and creates swelling and pressure, damaging cells and tissues in the brain. 
A rupture of the middle meningeal artery leads to an epidural hematoma and shows a biconvex, hyperdense blood collection and is classically secondary to a traumatic skull fracture.
A rupture of the bridging veins is seen in a subdural hematoma, which will be seen on CT scan as a crescent-shaped hemorrhage that crosses suture lines. 
Glioblastoma multiforme is a highly malignant primary brain tumor in adults that presents on CT with small areas of necrotizing tissue that are surrounded by anaplastic cells, hemorrhage, and or microvascular proliferation. 
Amyloid angiopathy is seen in patients with Alzheimer disease and may lead to intracranial hemorrhages, but this patient has no signs of dementia.
Ruptured berry aneurysms cause subarachnoid hemorrhages, which will be seen on CT scan as hyperdense material filling the CSF-containing regions of the brain and are not usually well-demarcated.
Baclofen is first-line therapy for spasticity in patients with MS. The drug works by activating GABAB receptors and inhibiting the transmission of both monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes at the level of the spinal cord, thereby inducing muscle relaxation. Baclofen is also used in other movement disorders, such as spinal cord injuries and cerebral palsy
Together with ectopia lentis (a displaced lens), aortic involvement is a primary hallmark of Marfan syndrome and may be manifest with dilation of the aortic root leading to aortic regurgitation that is detectable on auscultation as a decrescendo diastolic murmur. Aortic dissection and mitral valve prolapse may also be seen
T2—level of sternal angle
 T4—level of nipples
 T6—level of xiphoid
 T10—level of umbilicus
 T12—level of the midpoint between umbilicus and pubic symphysis
 L1—level of pubic crest
Vecuronium is a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent. It is an acetylcholine receptor antagonist that never stimulates the motor endplate nACh receptors and does not lead to fasciculations.
Propofol is used to rapidly induce anesthesia; it does not cause nAChR blockade. Propofol is thought to act on GABAA receptors.
Lidocaine is a local anesthetic used to induce numbness in a specific area. It would not be given intravenously as part of general anesthesia and does not cause fasciculations.
Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is used for pain control during general anesthesia but does not cause fasciculations.
Dantrolene is used in treatment of malignant hyperthermia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. It prevents release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle by binding the ryanodine receptor. It does not cause fasciculations.
In skeletal muscle, the RYR is the calcium channel on the sarcoplasmic reticulum which is coupled to a voltage sensitive dihydropyridine calcium channel. 
Remember skeletal muscle is calcium channel induced calcium release, so it is an actual physical coupling of the receptors which causes the RYR to open (this is different than in cardiac muscle where the RYR are calcium induced, and it is a binding of calcium that triggers their opening)
In the heart, dihydropyridine receptors are also called L-type calcium channels or Long-acting. T-type are a completely different channel and are transient (respond to lower voltage). RYR are still RYR but a different subtype than in skeletal muscle.
Two signals are required for T cell activation. Signal 1 is the antigen that is presented to the T cell receptor (TCR) by an APC’s MHC class II. Signal 2 is known as the co-stimulatory signal, and this occurs via the interaction of B7 protein (CD80/86) on the APC and CD28 on the T cell. This leads to T helper cell activation.
A newly admitted elderly patient presents with agitation, fever, and confusion = DELIRIUM. Delirium is the most common disease/disorder in a newly hospitalized patient. Reversible, unlike dementia. Rapid onset, too.
This individual has horizontal conjugate gaze palsy, likely intranuclear opthalmoplegia which is commonly a symptom of MS (hence her relapsing remitting history) [FA2020 p543]
Intranuclear opthalmoplegia can be caused by a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus, which is located at "C" on the diagram. Here is a picture pointing out the MLF, which cooresponds to C on the diagram.
The Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus is what allows for cross-talk between CNVI and CNIII for conjugate gaze.

Retained primary teeth, thickening of facial soft tissue (ie, leathery appearance of the face), and a history of recurrent skin infections without erythema -> IgE syndrome (Job syndrome). Gene mutation in STAT3. In this disease, TH17 cells fail to produce interleukin-17 (IL-17), leading to an inability of neutrophils to respond to chemotactic stimuli. Consequently, the inflammatory response is blunted in these patients, resulting in frequent staphylococcal abscesses that lack the expected warmth and erythema ("cold abscesses"). The presence and activation of immunoglobulin E (IgE) leads to eczema. A method to memorize the findings of Job syndrome is the FATED mnemonic: Facies that are coarse, Abscesses that are cold, Teeth that are retained (baby), E is increased (IgE), Dermatologic problems.
A failure to synthesize major histocompatibility complex II antigens is seen in severe combined immunodeficiency, which would present with infections seen in immunocompromised individuals such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia or disseminated fungal infections
In leukocyte adhesion deficiency, the inability of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 binding prevents migration of leukocytes to the site of infection. This would present with delayed umbilical cord separation and abscesses without pus formation.
Chronic bacterial infections and oculocutaneous albinism are signs of Chédiak-Higashi syndrome, which is caused by an autosomal-recessive defect in the lysosomal-trafficking regulator gene, resulting in failure of microtubule-mediated lysosomal transport and fusion of vesicles to the cell membrane. Stalled lysosomal vesicles can be observed histologically as darkened granules within cell cytoplasm.
 Progressive destruction of B and T cells occurs in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome due to a lack of cytoskeletal proteins. This would present with thrombocytopenia, eczema, and recurrent pyogenic infections.
Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency presents very early in life with Pneumocystis pneumonia, thrush, and failure to thrive. ADA deficiency inhibits metabolism of deoxyadensine resulting in accumulation of this metabolite. In turn, there is an increase in the levels of deoxyadenosine triphosphate and S-adenosylhomocystine, which are toxic to lymphocytes and inhibit DNA synthesis in these actively replicating cells. A lymphopenic state results in the SCID phenotype. As macrophages are still functional in these patients, mycobacterial infections are not common.
Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) deficiency results in X-linked agammaglobulinemia, which causes poor immune response to bacterial infections, especially encapsulated organisms. BTK is a cell surface signal transduction protein that signals B-cell maturation. Impaired B-cell function results in poor antibody production. As macrophages are still functional in these patients, mycobacterial infections are not common.
Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is caused by ineffective demargination - migration of neutrophils to infections. There are several mutations that can result in LAD, however they all share similar pathophysiology. Integrins are vital cell adhesion molecules which allow leukocytes to adhere to the wall of blood vessels and enter the tissues. If the building blocks of these molecules, such as CD18, are missing, then the leukocytes will not be able to migrate toward infections.These patients present with cold abscesses (abscesses that lack intense inflammation and are also described as a soft tissue mass) and staphylococcal infections. As macrophages are still functional in these patients, mycobacterial infections are not common.
Cystic fibrosis is not a true immunodeficiency but does put patients at risk of pulmonary disease. Impaired chloride channel function results in poor hydration of mucus in the sinopulmonary system, leading to poor clearance of mucus and bacteria and inflammation. Bacteria colonize this thick mucus and then cause infections. It will most commonly cause staphylococcal pneumonia, not mycobacterial disease, in this age group.

Viridans streptococci (eg, S. mutans, S. sanguinis, S. oralis, and S. mitis) are gram-positive cocci that grow in chains. They often cause subacute bacterial endocarditis, particularly in the setting of mitral valve prolapse.

biopsy specimen contains highly mitotic, basophilic lymphocytes, surrounding clear zones of macrophages giving characteristic "starry sky" appearance. These features are highly suggestive of Burkitt lymphoma. Genetic translocation in Burkitt lymphoma, involving the c-myc gene on chromosome 8 and the immunoglobulin heavy chain of chromosome 14
Somatic mosaicism occurs when the somatic cells of the body are composed of two different genotypes. It cannot be passed down between generations because it does not affect the gametes. 
In incomplete dominance the mutant gene is not fully dominant over the appropriate gene, so the phenotype of the two genes is mixed, often leading to a milder phenotype of disease. 
Uniparental disomy is when two copies of the mutant gene are inherited from one parent, and the other parent does not contribute a gene. This is typically seen in Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes. 
Heteroplasmy is an inheritance pattern based on mitochondrial DNA, which is passed through the maternal line. In heteroplasmy, there is a mixture of inherited mitochondrial DNA, leading to a range of disease presentation. 
Locus heterogeneity is mutations at different genes at different locations causing the same disorder. 
Allelic heterogeneity is when different mutations at the same location lead to the same or very similar phenotypes
S. aureus is a common cause of secondary bacterial pneumonia after initial infection with the influenza virus. Its principal virulence factor is protein A, which binds the Fc portion of antibodies and makes them unable to opsonize the microbe.
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of pneumonia and is an a-hemolytic gram-positive coccus, but it is not the most common cause of postinfluenza pneumonia. 
Klebsiella pneumoniae  features a capsular polysaccharide as a virulence factor and is commonly associated with aspiration pneumonia in patients with diabetes or alcoholism and also with hospital-acquired pneumonia. 
IgA protease is a virulence factor secreted by Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria infections. Mycoplasma pneumoniae does not have a cell wall, but it is not detected by Gram staining and does not cause a productive cough
Production of frothy, dark urine should raise suspicion for glomerular disease. One common cause of postinfectious glomerulonephritis is infection with β-hemolytic streptococci, such as Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition to causing nephritic syndrome, S. pyogenes can also cause acute rheumatic fever if left untreated. Although rheumatic fever is a well-known cause of pancarditis, it can also induce Sydenham chorea, a restless, uncontrollable movement of the extremities. 

In its early stages, acute rheumatic fever can cause mitral regurgitation; however, this is not always the case. In later stages, stenosis can develop (mitral > aortic > tricuspid) as the valve orifice narrows. Such a condition is evidenced by the presence of a murmur and a possible arrhythmia. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and acute rheumatic fever are immune-mediated type II hypersensitivity reactions, resulting in an M protein cross- reaction with host antigens (molecular mimicry). Although treatment with penicillin at the time of infection greatly reduces the risk of  developing acute rheumatic fever, it does not prevent poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis sequelae.
Adenosine works by hyperpolarizing AV node tissue, increasing conductance of potassium and reducing calcium current. As a result, the conduction through the AV node is markedly reduced. Adenosine's extremely short duration of action (15 seconds) also limits the occurrence of its adverse effects (ie, hypotension, flushing, chest pain, and dyspnea).
Amiodarone is a potassium channel blocker (class III), which will prolong the repolarization phase.
Flecainide is used when ventricular tachycardia progresses to ventricular fibrillation; it is also used for intractable supraventricular tachycardia.
Lidocaine, a class Ib antiarrhythmic, is used in the treatment of acute ventricular arrhythmias such as postmyocardial infarction arrhythmias.
Sotalol, a β-adrenergic-receptor blocker (class II) and a potassium channel blocker (class III), is used only for severe symptomatic arrhythmias
Statins competitively inhibit hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis, by obstructing part of the enzyme's active site. The subsequent decrease in intrahepatic cholesterol causes upregulation of hepatic LDL cholesterol receptors, ultimately lowering plasma LDL cholesterol levels. The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) is the concentration of a substrate that brings about an initial velocity that is half the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the reaction. Because statins bind to the same binding site as the substrates of the enzyme, statins increase HMG-CoA reductase's apparent Km
In patients with states of effective volume depletion, such as heart failure and cirrhosis, the secretion of the vasoconstrictors angiotensin II and norepinephrine increases. In these cases, secretion of prostaglandins (mostly prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2) increases to maintain renal blood flow by counteracting the vasoconstrictive effects of these hormones at preglomerular vessels (eg, the afferent arteriole). When prostaglandin synthesis is inhibited by NSAIDs in these patients, preglomerular resistance increases and renal blood flow (and thus glomerular filtration rate) is reduced. This is reversible with stopping the NSAID. 
A patient presenting with hereditary spherocytosis is likely to have an increased reticulocyte count
Decreased ferritin most commonly suggests iron deficiency anemia.
 An increased hematocrit is most likely associated with dehydration, polycythemia vera, or other lung and heart diseases. 
A decreased reticulocyte count suggests either an inherent bone marrow defect or shortage of RBC precursor (iron, folate, vitamin B12).
 An increased mean corpuscular volume is called a macrocytosis. The most common macrocytic anemias include folate and vitamin B12 deficiency, liver disease, and alcoholism (which can lead to both nutrient deficiency and liver disease).
Wilms tumor arises from neoplastic embryonic renal cells of the metanephros, there is an abnormal proliferation of the metanephric blastema usually referred as nephrogenic rests. Nephrogenic rests may usually regress in childhood, however, if they do not regress, they may transform in Wilms tumor. There are many mutations associated with Wilms tumor such as WT1, FWT1m FWT2 and p53. In the case of WT1 mutation, Wilms tumor can also be associated with WAGR syndrome and Denys-Drash syndrome. It is associated with the deletion of tumor suppressor gene WT1 on chromosome 11
The basic theory of operant conditioning is that behaviors can be modified by environmental consequences through reinforcement or punishment. Reinforcement makes a behavior more likely to occur, whereas punishment makes a behavior less likely to occur. Both reinforcement and punishment can be either positive or negative.
The murmur of aortic stenosis can best be auscultated over the right sternal border between the second and third ribs. It can be heard as a crescendo-decrescendo systolic ejection murmur with a soft S2 that is  loudest at the base of the heart and radiates to the carotids. Pulses are often weak with a delayed peak (“pulsus parvus et tardus”). Common clinical presentations of aortic stenosis include syncope, angina, and dyspnea on exertion.
Berry aneurysms are thin outpouchings of the vessel walls that most commonly occur where cerebral arteries branch.
Epidural hematomas (from rupture of the middle meningeal artery) or subdural hematomas (from rupture of the bridging veins). 
Blockage of an anterior cerebral artery or a penetrating artery in the internal capsule (lacunar infarct) would cause motor or sensory deficits, but are unlikely to affect eye movement or cause loss of consciousness.
The superior gluteal nerve is derived from L4-S1 and innervates the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fascia lata.
 The common fibular (peroneal) nerve is derived from L4-S2 and supplies sensation to the lateral portions of the leg and foot. The common fibular nerve eventually splits into the superficial fibular nerve and deep fibular nerve, providing motor innervation to the lateral and anterior leg compartments, respectively.
 The tibial nerve is derived from L4-S3 and innervates the muscles in the posterior compartment of the leg and all the muscles in the sole of the foot.
 L5-S2 nerve roots form the inferior gluteal nerve, which innervates the gluteus maximus.
The pudendal nerve fibers are derived from S2-S4 and function to provide sensation of the genitals and perineum, along with motor control of the external urethral sphincter and the external anal sphincter
Motor innervation of the palatal arches and uvula is mediated, in part, by the vagus nerve (CN X), which innervates one of the muscles of the soft palate, the levator veli palatini. Deviation of the uvula to one side implicates a lower motor neuron (LMN) lesion contralateral to the side to which the uvula is deviating. So damage to the left CN X leads to right-sided uvular deviation, whereas damage to the right CN X would lead to left-sided uvular deviation. 
The other muscles of the soft palate (the tensor veli palatini and the intrinsic muscles of the soft palate) are innervated by the trigeminal nerve (CN V).
CN III (the oculomotor nerve) innervates many small muscles of the orbit that are responsible for moving the eye. LMN damage to this nerve results in ocular deficits in a classic “down and out” presentation due to unopposed trochlear and abducens nerve activity, which this patient does not have.
CN XII (hypoglossal nerve) mediates tongue movement, and LMN injury to one side the CN XII leads to ipsilateral tongue deviation because of the unopposed action of the opposite genioglossus muscle. So an injury to the left CN XII would result in deviation to the left, and injury to the right CN XII would result in deviation to the right. One way to remember this is by recalling the adage “The tongue licks its own wounds.”
The CN IX (glossopharyngeal nerve) mediates taste, salivation, and swallowing and innervates the stylopharyngeus to elevate the larynx and pharynx.
LMN damage to this nerve leads to defects in the afferent gag reflex and elevation of the larynx and pharynx but would not cause right uvular, tongue, or palatal deviation.
The three types of antigen presenting cells are dendritic cells, macrophages, and B lymphocytes. Therefore, these three cell types are responsible for T lymphocyte activation.
Lead inhibits synthesis of heme on two levels: (1) It blocks δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, and (2) it decreases iron incorporation into heme. Inherited defects of the same biochemical pathway responsible for this patient's symptoms can result in acute intermittent porphyria, producing abdominal pain and psychological disturbances, as well as porphyria cutanea tarda, characterized by photosensitivity.
Vitamin K is necessary for the γ-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues on clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X and the two anticoagulant enzymes, proteins C and S. 
Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, is a cofactor for the enzymes prolyl-3-hydroxylase, prolyl-4-hydroxylase, and lysyl hydroxylase, which are responsible for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues of collagen. Hyrdoxyproline and hydroxylysine are important for stabilizing collagen by cross-linking the propeptides in collagen to form its triple-helical structure. Hence, vitamin C deficiency causes many of its symptoms due to improper collagen formation.
Patients with decreased von Willebrand factor have a tendency to bleed. Decreased von Willebrand factor is associated with an increased partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and bleeding time.
Defect in carboxylation of coagulation factors would be seen in association with vitamin K deficiency. It would result in an increased prothrombin time (PT) and PTT.
Dysfunctional platelets may be a result of many factors, including medications (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin), liver disease, uremia, multiple myeloma, and diabetes mellitus. The characteristic symptom of dysfunctional platelets is mucosal or cutaneous bleeding.
Mutations of spectrin can lead to a disease called hereditary spherocytosis. Patients with this RBC membrane defect typically present with hemolytic anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly.
IgA nephropathy characteristically manifests with hematuria concurrently with an upper respiratory illness or pharyngitis ("synpharyngitic") in contrast to poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), which manifests 3–6 weeks after group A β-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis
Serum complement levels are typically normal in IgA nephropathy and low in PSGN.
Dense deposits within the basement membrane are characteristic of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) type II. 
Subendothelial deposits are usually seen in systemic lupus erythematosus. 
Podocyte effacement is seen in minimal change disease (MCD), which manifests with symptoms of nephrotic syndrome. 
Subepithelial humps are found in acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.
Hyper-IgM syndrome patients are typically boys (X-linked mutation) and are susceptible to recurrent sinopulmonary infections, opportunistic infections, and chronic diarrhea.
Amaurosis fugax is a transient (<30 minutes) condition characterized by monocular loss of vision due to embolic occlusion of the ophthalmic artery. This patient’s 3-hour vision loss makes this diagnosis unlikely.
Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) commonly presents as unilateral painless loss in vision and is often secondary to an embolic source, such as, atherosclerosis of the carotid artery(Hypertension), cardiac vegetation, patent foramen ovale, or can result from giant cell arteritis in individuals greater than the age of 40.
Hypertensive retinal hemorrhage can lead to painless unilateral loss of vision due to endothelial damage and fibrinous necrosis. On fundoscopy, flame-shaped hemorrhages, arteriovenous nicking, and thickening of the arterial walls may be present. 
Retinal detachment is the separation of neurosensory layer of the retina. However, it typically presents with a prodrome of “flashes” and “floaters” before eventual monocular painless vision loss. 
Closed angle glaucoma is due to narrowing out the anterior chamber, which impairs aqueous humor outflow. Fundoscopy may reveal cupping and papilledema. It is associated with progressive peripheral vision loss and typically very painful. 
Type V GSD (McArdle disease) would present in an older child, typically with muscle cramps and myoglobinuria with exercise. 
McArdle disease is caused by a deficiency of muscle glycogen phosphorylase.
Type III GSD (Cori disease) is caused by a deficiency of debranching enzyme AKA alpha-1,6-glucosidase and would present as a milder form of Von Gierke disease with hypoglycemia and normal lactate levels.
Von Gierke disease is the most common form of glycogen storage disease. It is caused by a deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase, which prevents glycogen breakdown into glucose and also prevents gluconeogenesis, causing hepatomegaly. Infants with Von Gierke disease typically have lab abnormalities that are not shown in this patient, including fasting hypoglycemia, elevated lactate, and elevated uric acid.
Type VI GSD is caused by deficiency of liver glycogen phosphorylase would present with mild fasting hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia and normal lactate/uric acid levels.
The combination of a systolic heart murmur, indicative of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and hypotonia point towards Pompe Disease or type II glycogen storage disease. Pompe disease is characterized by a deficiency of lysosomal alpha-1,4-glucosidase, which degrades glycogen to glucose within the lysosomes. Deficiency of this enzyme leads to accumulation of glycogen chains in the heart, liver, and muscle and causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, macroglossia, hypotonia, and exercise intolerance leading to early death. 
Translocation t(8;14) is diagnostic of Burkitt lymphoma and results in overexpression of c-myc.
t(9;22) translocation results in the Philadelphia chromosome, which is characteristic of chronic myeloid leukemia. 
Translocation t(11;14) characterizes mantle cell lymphoma. Translocation t(14;18) is commonly present in follicular lymphoma. 
Translocation t(15;17) is commonly associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia.
Binding of penicillin-binding proteins is the mechanism of action of carbapenem antibiotics, which are not commonly used to treat this patient's symptoms.
Acute mesenteric ischemia caused by arterial thrombosis -> Known atherosclerotic disease (coronary artery disease) and delayed postprandial abdominal pain -> abdominal angina -> extreme abdominal pain. Initial findings are relatively benign, but can later develop peritoneal signs consistent with bowel perforation -> septic shock. Full-thickness necrosis of the small bowel is consistent with ischemic necrosis. History of abdominal angina, an analogue of cardiac angina, in which peristaltic activity about 20–30 minutes after a meal increases oxygen demand by the bowel, outpacing arterial supply through atherosclerotic vessels.

Medical approaches to treating achalasia include using a calcium channel blocker, nitroglycerin, or botulinum toxin injections in the LES. Calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine decrease the availability of calcium to the myosin-actin complex, leading to smooth muscle relaxation. Nitroglycerin works through a cGMP-mediated mechanism to dephosphorylate and inactivate myosin light chains. Botulinum toxin causes muscle paralysis by inhibiting the exocytosis of acetylcholine from presynaptic neurons. Surgical corrections include pneumatic dilation and esophageal myotomy.
A patient’s decreased urine output, azotemia, and acute increase in serum creatinine in the setting of liver disease raise concern that he may be experiencing hepatorenal syndrome. Hepatorenal syndrome is a progressive functional renal failure caused by a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate due to declining liver function. It is characterized by splanchnic vasodilation and concomitant vasoconstriction in the renal vascular beds caused by the production of mediators and the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The combination of these two factors causes a prerenal type of azotemia, evidenced by the patient’s blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio > 21 and a fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) of 0.3%. Size and Shape of the Kidneys would be normal. 
Normal kidneys with a “flea-bitten” infarcted appearance are characteristic of patients with malignant hypertension.
Patient presents in severe pain at the groin area after a fall with swelling of the scrotum, blood at the urethral meatus, and an inability to void. Falls or “straddle injuries”. Source of injury is the Bulbous Urethra. 
A complete rupture of the anterior part of the bladder wall could result in flow of urine into the retropubic space. 
Penile urethra rupture typically occurs during penetrating injury, such as catheter insertion. 
Membranous urethra rupture typically occurs in high-velocity pelvic fractures as this is the weakest point of attachment. 
Prostatic urethra rupture rarely occurs and is caused by a fractured pelvis or improper catheter insertion.
Leucovorin ameliorates the myelosuppression associated with methotrexate
 Dexrazoxane prevents the cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines
 Amifostine prevents cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity
Cryptococcus appears as a heavily encapsulated nondimorphic yeast with narrow-based budding on India ink stain
Broad-based budding yeast refers to Blastomyces. Blastomyces is found in wooded areas east of the Mississippi River.
 Budding yeast with pseudohyphae refers to Candida albicans, which can cause thrush, vulvovaginitis, and numerous other mucocutaneous infections.
 Mold with hyphae that branch at 45-degree angles refers to Aspergillus fumigatus,which more commonly infects individuals with underlying pulmonary disease or those working in construction (due to inhalation exposure).
 Small intracellular yeast refers to Histoplasma, a fungus found in the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys.
Suspect child abuse when the injury and the story of the injury do not match; spiral fractures do not generally occur with a simple fall down the stairs. Other signs of child abuse are retinal hemorrhage and detachment due to shaking, abdominal trauma, scattered circular burns (cigarette burns), and subdural hematomas.
The Vibrio cholerae toxin ADP ribosylates the Gs-α subunit. This Gs-α subunit activates adenylyl cyclase but cannot hydrolyze the bound GTP to GDP. Therefore the Gs-α subunit continuously activates adenylyl cyclase, which increases cAMP levels and overactivates protein kinase A. Pprtein kinase A phosphorylates the CFTR chloride channel, increasing chlorine excretion and causing the subsequent H2O efflux and characteristic "rice-water" diarrhea.
Niacin's MOA- is reduced hepatic triglyceride and VLDL synthesis. Niacin is the cholesterol-lowering agent that causes the most significant increases in serum HDL. It also causes a modest decrease in LDL cholesterol
Increased excretion of bile acids in the stool is associated with cholestyramine. 
Inhibition of cholesterol absorption in the GI tract is the mechanism of action of ezetimibe. 
Statins work by inhibiting the action of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase.
Gemfibrozil is a fibrate, and exerts its effects through agonism of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α agonist.
Lab tests show an elevation in partial thromboplastin time, a prolonged bleeding time, and a normal prothrombin time. These findings are characteristic of patients on heparin, and her extreme thrombocytopenia suggests heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Patients with HIT should be immediately started on a direct thrombin inhibitor, such as argatroban or bivalirudin, to prevent thrombosis.
Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K are used to treat warfarin overdose (causing a supratherapeutic INR). Warfarin depletes the vitamin K–dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X) and FFP contains these factors. So, typically, FFP is given as a bridge until the body can build up its stock of vitamin K. 
Protamine sulfate is utilized in patients who overdosed on heparin with elevated PTTs (typically above 120s) and need rapid reversal. It can also be given to patients on heparin who need immediate surgery and therefore reversal of their PTT. Streptokinase, a thrombolytic agent used in cases of myocardial infarction, is contraindicated in anyone at risk of bleeding.
Celecoxib reduces the pain and inflammation of osteoarthritis, but because it blocks cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) enzymes only, it causes minimal GI adverse effects compared with other NSAIDs. All NSAIDs cause vasoconstriction with a predilection to affect the renal afferent arteriole more than the efferent arteriole.
Ibuprofen and naproxen inhibit COX-1 (active in the gut) and COX-2 (active in blood vessels) enzymes, thereby reducing production of prostaglandins
Angiotensin II mediates constriction of both the efferent and afferent arterioles with a greater effect on the efferent arteriole. 
Nitric oxide causes dilation of the afferent arterioles and would not be an appropriate treatment. 
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors dilate efferent arterioles and are used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. 
Belligerent demeanor along with physical symptoms—fever, elevated heart rate, hypertension, and nystagmus—are hallmark signs of phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication. PCP acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist. The treatment is typically benzodiazepines, though haloperidol may be used for severe symptoms.
Flumazenil is used to treat benzodiazepine overdose, which manifests similarly to alcohol intoxication.
 N-Acetylcysteine is used to treat acetaminophen overdose, which manifests with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. 
 Naloxone is used to treat opioid intoxication, which manifests with sedation and CNS depression.
 Sodium bicarbonate is used to treat TCA overdose, which manifests with coma, convulsions, and cardiac toxicity.
A pulsating midline abdominal mass, a finding characteristic of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). It may or may not be associated with a midline abdominal bruit. Although the patient had no medical concerns prior to his visit, his 45-pack-year history of smoking constitutes a risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Other risk factors include build-up of atherosclerotic plaque or atherosclerosis.
Intimal tear is commonly associated with aortic dissection. Symptoms often include a crushing pain that radiates to the back. Some patients experience differences in blood pressure between left and right upper extremities.
 Radiation therapy and Kussmaul sign (jugular venous distention that fails to subside on inspiration) - constrictive pericarditis
Child/YA presents with periodic temperatures associated with rash; enlarged lymph nodes, liver, and spleen; RBC-laden macrophages, polyarticular joint pain, swelling, and a transient macular, salmon-pink rash present anywhere on the body and low hematocrit. This constellation of symptoms is most suggestive of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
Rheumatoid factor is not usually present. Also associated with chronic anterior uveitis and decreased growth rates, and 30%–50% of patients develop hemophagocytic syndrome, in which macrophages begin digesting RBCs (cause of this patient's low hematocrit)TX: NSAID’s, corticosteroids, methotrexate, intravenous immune globulin, and newer biologic drugs such as etanercept, which acts as decoy receptor for tumor necrosis factor. In adults, systemic JIA is also known as Still disease.
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is an important differential for patients with possible lupus nephritis because FSGS occurs more commonly in patients with SLE. Lupus nephritis results from the deposition of glomerular immune complexes, which activate the complement cascade and lead to complement-mediated damage. In contrast, FSGS has appearances of segmental sclerosis and hyalinosis. Treatment of lupus nephritis consists of high-dose steroids combined with either cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil.
Effacement of foot processes supporting the renal epithelial podocytes seen on electron microscopy (shown in this image) is the classic finding in minimal change disease (MCD), which is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children
Tubular infiltration of polymorphonuclear WBCs is a common renal finding seen in pyelonephritis
Proteus or Klebsiella -the high urine pH provides a suitable environment for the formation of ammonium magnesium phosphate stones, also known as struvite stones.
Calcium oxalate stones are the most common type of kidney stones. They may occur in the setting of hypercalciuria, hyperparathyroidism, hypocitraturia, ethylene glycol ingestion, vitamin C abuse, malabsorption, or dehydration. 
Calcium phosphate stones may occur in the setting of hypercalciuria or hyperparathyroidism and often precipitate with increased urine pH. 
Cystine stones are pathognomonic for cystinuria, which is characterized by high levels of of the amino acid cystine. They can be recognized by a positive nitroprusside test result. 
Uric acid stones are formed in the setting of hyperuricemia and can occur in gout or in settings of high cell turnover, such as leukemia.
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). The disease is caused by mutations in sarcomere genes, such as the β-myosin heavy chain. HOCM is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.
Transthyretin deposits cause amyloidosis
Metastatic breast cancer that was initially treated with chemotherapy. However, the tumors soon returned to their original size because of a mutation affecting β-tubulin disassembly, which is the mechanism of action of taxanes, such as paclitaxel. Notably, this is a slightly different mechanism of action of another common chemotherapeutic vincristine, which acts by preventing microtubule assembly. 
Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant and is often used in transplant recipients to control graft-versus-host disease that may result from allogeneic bone transplant. The drug inhibits transcription of interleukin-2 and other cytokines important for T-lymphocyte activation, thus dampening the cell-mediated immune response. However, cyclosporine has potential renal toxicity.
Azathioprine is a prodrug for the immunosuppressant 6-mercaptopurine, but neither agent causes significant renal toxicity.
Dacluzimab is an interleukin-2 receptor antagonist and muromab-CD3 is a CD3 receptor antagonist. Neither causes marked renal impairment effects.
Mycophenolate is an IMPDH inhibitor preventing the synthesis of purines. Like azathioprine, bone marrow suppression is the worrisome side effect, not renal toxicity.
Waldenström macroglobulinemia causes a protein spike on serum protein electrophoresis, indicative of plasmacytoid lymphocytes, but lytic bone lesions are absent. 
Acute myelogenous leukemia is marked by neoplastic proliferation of myeloblasts. 
Prostate cancer, parathyroid cancer, and lung cancer can metastasize to bone, but they would be unlikely to cause an M-spike in the serum protein electrophoresis.
During sexual differentiation in the embryo (week six), there are two pairs of genital ducts: Mullerian (paramesonephric) and Wolffian (mesonephric). In normal female development, the ovary secretes estrogen which leads to Wolffian duct regression and preservation of the Mullerian duct. The Mullerian duct is responsible for the development of the upper vagina, uterus, and fallopian tubes. In Mayer–Rokitansky–Küster–Hauser syndrome (MRKH), there is spontaneous degeneration of the paramesonephric (Mullerian) duct and therefore agenesis of the upper vagina, which presents as a blind vaginal pouch on physical exam. Notably, patients still have normal ovaries and can produce estrogen, which leads to normal secondary sexual characteristics (breast and pubic hair development).
Polycythemia vera is a myeloproliferative disorder that results from a JAK2 mutation, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase. This mutation leads to constitutive activation of the JAK2, signal transducer of activation (STAT) pathway and uncontrolled hematopoietic proliferation. This results in excessive RBCs, WBCs, and platelets
Cardiotoxicity is an adverse effect of doxorubicin, which is an antitumor antibiotic used in the treatment of multiple malignancies including lymphomas and bladder, breast, and lung cancer. 
Nephrotoxicity is an adverse effect of calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus and cyclosporin, sometimes used to treat IBD. 
Orange discoloration of body fluids is an adverse effect of sulfasalazine, a sulfa drug prescribed for long-term control of IBD. 
Pneumonitis is a rare adverse effect of methotrexate, which is also used occasionally to treat IBD. 
Peripheral neuropathy is a side effect of vincristine, which is used in the treatment of acute leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor, Hodgkin disease, and other lymphomas.
Leuprolide is a gonadotropin-release hormone (GnRH) agonist that binds GnRH receptors in the pituitary in a constant fashion, as opposed to the physiologic pulsatile release of GnRH. Constant activation of GnRH receptors by leuprolide desensitizes the receptors and inhibits the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). As a result, downstream androgen synthesis is reduced, causing regression of the tumor.
An initial increase in FSH and LH can be expected in this patient since leuprolide first activates GnRH before its constant activation produces the inhibitory effect. The most common adverse effects of leuprolide include hot flashes, cardiovascular changes or ischemia, fatigue, pain, peripheral edema, and erectile dysfunction. 
After confirmation of ischemic stroke -> within the past 3–4.5 hours, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) can be administered -> stimulating the production of plasmin, which breaks down fibrin, ultimately dissolving the clot. Potential adverse effects of tPA: excessive bleeding (e.g. bleeding from gums and developing subcutaneous ecchymoses). Stop the bleeding -> Aminocaproic acid, which is an antifibrinolytic that acts by blocking the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, effectively counteracting the mechanism of tPA.

Parinaud syndrome, also known as the dorsal midbrain syndrome, is a supranuclear vertical gaze disturbance caused by compression of the tectal plate. It is characterized by an upward gaze palsy, often manifesting as diplopia. It has been classically associated with young patients with brain tumors in the pineal gland or midbrain. Pinealomas are the most common lesion producing this syndrome. 
Patients have a right to refuse blood transfusions for themselves, but parents do not have the authority to refuse life-saving treatment for their children.
This patient presents with urinary incontinence, gait disturbances, and cognitive impairment (difficulty paying bills, memory impairment regarding falls) along with expanded ventricles shown in the CT scan. This presentation is consistent with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which is a condition of the elderly characterized by chronically dilated ventricles. NPH is a type of communicating hydrocephalus.
In contrast, a noncommunicating hydrocephalus, also known as obstructive hydrocephalus, does not allow CSF to flow through the ventricular system, as in the case of aqueductal stenosis. Noncommunicating hydrocephalus causes an increase in CSF pressure in the ventricles. This patient has normal CSF pressure, ruling out a noncommunicating pathology. They would have a headache etc. 

Autosomal dominant dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (vWF). vWF has two main functions: (1) adhesion of platelets to collagen via glycoproteins, and (2) as a carrier molecule for factor VIII. Thus vWD results in decreased factor VIII levels and a prolonged partial thromboplastin time. Reduced ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation is a specific and sensitive test of plasma vWF activity.
Impairment of factor IX activation results in hemophilia B, which manifests as defective secondary hemostasis (eg, hemarthrosis, intracranial hemorrhage). In contrast, this patient has signs of impaired primary hemostasis—epistaxis and easy bruising.

 Impaired formation of covalent bonds between fibrin chains suggests a deficiency in factor XIII. 
 Impaired inactivation of factors V and VIII suggests a deficiency in protein C, which results in a prothrombotic state.
SCC most likely arose in this patient from actinic keratosis, which is caused by increased sun exposure. Actinic keratosis presents as a small, rough, and erythematous brown papule or plaque. The initial lesion has a sandpaper-like texture, which later becomes scaly.
Lichen planus, which is associated with hepatitis C, presents as purple, planar, polygonal, and pruritic lesions. Hepatitis C is associated with cirrhosis and liver cancer, which will present with symptoms of portal hypertension. 
A junctional nevus is a benign skin lesion, which manifests as a highly pigmented lesion of <5 mm. 
Keratoacanthoma is a low-grade variant of SCC and not its precursor. It presents as a round, erythematous nodule with a central crater and no telangiectasias.
Cyclophosphamide is cell cycle nonspecific. It is an alkylating agent that covalently bonds to DNA at guanine N-7. Cyclophosphamide rapidly controls cancer cells but is also very toxic and can cause jaundice, anemia and hemorrhagic cystitis, among other adverse effects. 
5-Fluorouracil, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate act during the S phase of the cell cycle 
Etoposide is active in both in the S phase and the G2 phase
Vincristine is an M-phase-specific agent.
The guanine-to-cytosine bond is stronger than the adenine-to-thymine bond because guanine and cytosine form three hydrogen bonds, while adenine and thymine form only two hydrogen bonds. As a result, it takes more energy to break the bonds between guanine and cytosine. 
Treatment for pheochromocytoma is surgical removal when possible. To protect against hypertensive crisis during surgery, patients must be treated preoperatively with phenoxybenzamine, a long-acting irreversible α-antagonist. Blockade of α-adrenergic receptors causes relaxation of the vessels and a decrease in blood pressure. Miosis, or pupillary constriction, is a possible adverse effect, and patients may find that their vision is particularly affected in the dark. A β-blocker must also be administered to address the excessive stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors and to reduce the risk of reflex tachycardia. It is essential that the β-blocker be administered after administration of the α-blocker. Reversing this order poses a danger to the patient in this situation.

 Interleukin-9 (IL-9) is produced by T lymphocytes and plays a role in mast cell activation.
In addition to erection, S2-S4 fibers (through the pudendal nerve) are also responsible for anal and penile sensations (via inferior rectal and dorsal nerves, respectively). A useful mnemonic is “S2-3-4 keeps the penis off the floor.
A patient with arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis after treatment for chlamydial infection (obligate intracellular organism) is presenting with reactive arthritis. It is characterized by the triad of conjunctivitis, urethritis and arthritis and is formerly known as Reiter syndrome.  Sacroiliitis is a painful condition where either one or both of the sacroiliac joints become inflamed and can be a symptom of reactive arthritis. Sexually transmitted infections as well as gastrointestinal infections may precipitate reactive arthritis. The following bacteria have been implicated: Shigella, Yersinia, Chlamydia, Campylobacterand Salmonella.  
Rabies is a single-stranded RNA virus of the Lyssavirus genus and is typically carried by bats, raccoons, and stray dogs. After inoculation, glycoproteins on the viral surface latch onto the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and facilitate entrance into motor and sensory neurons. The virus then travels via retrograde axonal transport, reaching the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord and eventually the brain. Histologic examination reveals Negri bodies, which are eosinophilic inclusion bodies seen in the cytoplasm of neurons of patients infected with rabies.
At 3 months, the Moro reflex disappears; at 4 months, the rooting reflex disappears; at 6 months, the palmar reflex disappears. By the time a child is 24 months old, all of the primitive reflexes have disappeared plantar (Babinski) reflex.
There is no cure for myasthenia gravis and treatment is symptomatic. Pyridostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used in the management of chronic myasthenia gravis and has a duration of action of 3 to 6 hours. The drug acts in the synaptic cleft by competing with ACh for attachment to acetylcholinesterase, thus prolonging the effects of ACh. Neostigmine is also a acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, but its duration of action is only two to four hours. Thymectomy is first-line treatment for patients with generalized myasthenia gravis.
Rivastigmine is also an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, but it is not used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. 
Edrophonium is a reversible acetylcholinesterase that is used for diagnosis of myasthenia gravis but not treatment. 
Pilocarpine does not act on acetylcholinergic receptors.
 Vecuronium is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent that acts as a competitive Ach antagonist. It is used as a paralytic agent in surgery.
The underlying mechanism of DIC is activation of the coagulation cascade, which leads to microthrombi and global consumption of platelets, fibrin, and coagulation factors. Thrombus formation in the microvasculature results in microangiopathy with schistocytes and helmet-shaped cells. Complications include bleeding (eg, epistaxis in this patient), thrombosis, and organ failure. Laboratory findings include elevated prothrombin time, elevated partial thromboplastin time, elevated D-dimer level, and decreased platelet count. 
The splenic (left colic) flexure of the large intestine is most vulnerable to ischemia from hypoperfusion, because it is at the borderline of an area between the junction of two vascular territories: the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. The patient develops acidosis because of ischemia, leading to an anaerobic metabolism and resulting production of lactic acid.
Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Waldenström macroglobulinemia is a rare B-lymphocyte lymphoproliferative disorder that often results in a syndrome of blood hyperviscosity, secondary to increased levels of IgM (both heavy and light chains), which are secreted by neoplastic plasma cells.

Several organisms that cause respiratory tract infections, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, do not cause a hemorrhagic pleural effusion.
 Anaerobic gram-positive rods in chains, such as Clostridium and Actinomyces spp. (with branching filaments), can cause disease in humans; however, symptoms do not include respiratory tract infection.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) is endemic to Asia. HBV-associated HCC may occur in younger adults (20–40 years old) without cirrhosis because HBV may integrate into the host genome of hepatocytes and induce oncogenic changes.
Glioblastomas are typically found in the hemispheres and involve hemorrhagic and necrotic foci surrounded by pseudopalisading cells. These tumors often result in neurologic symptoms due to mass. Patients often have headaches, focal neurologic findings, nausea, and vomiting. They frequently present after a seizure.
Anaplastic astrocytoma has a histologic appearance similar to that of glioblastoma but lacks necrosis and vascular or endothelial cell proliferation. 
Pilocytic astrocytomas are a low-grade astrocytoma typically found in the posterior fossa of children and are uncommon in adults. Pathology would show bipolar neoplastic cells with elongated hair like processes that are arranged in parallel bundles and resemble mats of hair. Pilocytic astrocytomas often have Rosenthal fibers, which are swollen pink axons.
Mental status, discolored urine/myoglobinuria, muscle rigidity, and fever subsequent to the addition of haloperidol -> neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which can be a serious adverse effect of antipsychotic (neuroleptic) agents due to a decrease in dopamine signaling induced by haloperidol. Rx: discontinue all neuroleptics, dantrolene and bromocriptine. Dantroline is a skeletal muscle relaxant that works by inhibiting calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle. Bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist commonly used to treat Parkinson disease, can also reverse this process.
Cyproheptadine is used to treat serotonin syndrome.
Recurrent sinus and ear infections, along with reduced serum immunoglobulin levels, absent tonsils, and absent germinal centers on lymph-node biopsy. This is suggestive of X-linked agammaglobulinemia, an inherited condition caused by a defect in the gene coding for Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). This protein is crucial for the maturation of B cells, and in its absence, patients have decreased immune function and increased risk of bacterial infections. TX: administration of intravenous γ-globulin injections which passively improves the patient’s immune function.

G6PD>X-linked recessive disease making it much more common in men than in women. Symptoms can still present in female offspring of those who are carriers of the disease through lyonization. One part of the X chromosome is inactivated (heterochromatin) and the other corresponding part of the second X chromosome is activated (euchromatin).  If the activated portion of the second chromosome contains mutant DNA, then X-linked recessive diseases can present. 
De novo mutation often seen in AD mutations such as achondroplasia. 
Loss of heterozygosity is associated with individuals who inherit a mutation that makes them more susceptible to cancer. 
Incomplete penetrance is seen in families in which an AD disease skips a generation, but is present in the next generation. 
Gonadal mosaicism> half of a parent’s gametes carry a mutation; they themselves do not phenotypically express the mutation, but they are able to pass it on to their children.
Hydatidiform moles are cystic swellings of the chorionic villi with little to no associated fetal tissue. They often come to clinical attention in the fourth and fifth months of pregnancy with vaginal bleeding. the uterus is larger than expected for gestational age, and the serum BHCG level is higher than normal. Partial moles may contain some fetal tissue but no viable fetus, some normal villi, and some vesicular/abnormal chorionic villi. A complete mole contains no fetal tissue and completely vesicular/abnormal chorionic villi. Hydatidiform moles must be removed because they may lead to choriocarcinoma, an aggressive neoplasm that metastasizes early but is very responsive to chemotherapy.

Homocystinuria> tall marfanoid habitus, downward and inward lens subluxation, acute MI at a young age. Intellectual disability is also a common finding. Cystathionine synthase deficiency. Cystathionine synthase converts homocysteine to cystathionine and uses vitamin B6 as a cofactor. Vitamin B6 is converted to pyridoxal phosphate, which is a cofactor used in various reactions, such as transamination, decarboxylation reactions, and glycogen phosphorylase. Treatment for cystathionine synthase deficiency is restriction of methionine and an increase in cysteine, vitamins B6 and B12, and folate in the diet.
Pyruvate carboxylase is the first enzyme in gluconeogenesis. A deficiency in this enzyme would impair glucose synthesis
A deficiency in methionine synthase can cause homocystinuria; however, this reaction uses vitamin B12, not B6. Methionine synthase converts homocysteine to methionine.

Acetaminophen OD - treatment may be initiated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which is a precursor for the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione. Excess glutathione normally forms conjugates with the toxic metabolite of acetaminophen, NAPQI, which accumulates and causes liver damage after glutathione depletion. Replenishing glutathione with NAC will improve elimination of NAPQI and prevent further liver injury. 
Bruton X-linked agammaglobulinemia >>bacterial pneumonia (eg, fever, tachypnea, wheezing, flared nostrils, belly breathing, blue-gray discoloration of the lips, and decreased activity, underdeveloped tonsils and history of recurrent infections, suggestive of a defect in the humoral (antibody-mediated) immune response. X-linked; caused by a defect in tyrosine kinase signaling. The BTK gene is mutated & normally encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor. PT is unable to mediate B-cell expansion and progression in cell development. B cells are arrested at the pre-B-cell stage so that they cannot produce immunoglobulins. IgG, IgM & IgA decreased. 
IgG, IgA, and IgE levels; elevated IgM level are results indicative of hyper-IgM syndrome, infections similar to Bruton X-linked agammaglobulinemia. However, patients with hyper-IgM syndrome will have enlarged tonsils as opposed to the diminished or absent tonsils.

The radial nerve is commonly injured by a midshaft fracture of the humerus or compression of the axilla from crutches or arm over the chair. This presents as a wrist drop, decreased grip strength, and loss of sensation over the posterior arm and forearm.
Ulnar nerve injury occurs commonly from a fracture of the medial epicondyle of humerus. This presents as loss of wrist flexion, flexion of medial fingers, abduction and adduction of fingers, and loss of sensation over the medial fingers (little finger and half of the ring finger), and hypothenar eminence.
Injury to the recurrent branch of the median nerve occurs from superficial lacerations of the palm, which leads to loss of thenar muscle group activity (eg, opposition, abduction and flexion of thumb).
The axillary nerve is injured by a surgical neck of fracture and anterior dislocation of humerus. This leads to a flattened deltoid and loss of sensation over the deltoid muscle and lateral arm.
The musculocutaneous nerve is injured by upper trunk compression which leads to loss of forearm flexion and supination and loss of sensation over the lateral forearm.
Signs of a median nerve injury include the inability to make a fist (eg, ape hand deformity), pain with pronation of the forearm, and loss of wrist flexion, lateral finger flexion, and thumb opposition. Additionally, there is loss of sensation over the thenar eminence and dorsal and palmar aspects of the lateral 3.5 digits. 
A child presenting with widening and thickening of the wrist bones, craniotabes, and genu varum (“bowed legs”) >>rickets. Diet & dark skin predispose child to vitamin D deficiency and consequent impairment of bone mineralization, 
Factor V Leiden is the most common inherited cause of hypercoagulability, a pathologic state that predisposes the affected individual to thrombus formation. It is more common in the Caucasian population than other ethnicities. Normally, activated protein C cleaves factor V, terminating the clotting cascade. In people with factor V Leiden, factor Va is resistant to this cleavage, preventing protein C from degrading factor  ->  5-fold increase risk of DVT or PE in heterozygosity; homozygosity confers a 90-fold increased risk.

Fractures of the femoral neck result in increased risk of injury to the medial femoral circumflex artery. The medial femoral circumflex artery supplies blood to the femoral head and neck. Can cause Osteonecrosis
Treatment for ALL is divided into three phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance. Induction is designed to put the patient in remission and usually consists of treatment with vincristine, L-asparaginase, and prednisone. Prednisone acts as an agonist, passing through the plasma membrane and binding to the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor. The prednisone-glucocorticoid receptor complex then travels into the nucleus, where it binds to inverted DNA repeats, causing activation or suppression of specific genes and leading to apoptosis of immature lymphocytes. The prednisone-glucocorticoid receptor complex also leads to the production of anti-inflammatory proteins and suppresses cytokine synthesis. Prednisone also suppresses neutrophil migration and inhibits the production of cyclooxygenase-2.
AAT deficiency -> increased elastase activity -> loss of elastic fibers and increased lung compliance -> panacinar emphysema. Elevated ALT and AST due to accumulation of dysfunctional AAT in hepatocytes where it is produced -> liver damage and eventually cirrhosis

Negative NBT test in NADPH deficiency -> CGD
 Superoxide dismutase is an antioxidant enzyme. Deficiency is associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
Shigella dysentariae and Escherichia coli O157:H7-- both express shiga-toxin, with A and B components, these toxins can cause acute kidney injury, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, DIC, thrombocytopenia and fever. The B component binds to the cell membrane and allows entry of the A toxin. This component inactivates ribosomes, thereby stopping protein synthesis, which leads to cell death. They attach to intestinal epithelium, but only Shigella bacteria itself can invade the M cells in Peyer's patches of gastrointestinal mucosa and use the host cell filaments.

BPH is caused by dihydrotestosterone (DHT), an activated metabolite of testosterone, which stimulates proliferation of glandular cells in the periurethral and transitional zones of the prostate. 
N. gonorrhoeae have specialized antigenically variable pili that mediate their attachment to mucosal surfaces. These surface-associated pili vary continually so that an effective immune response cannot be mounted. This is the reason that individuals can be repeatedly infected.
A life cycle involving an extracellular infectious form and intracellular replicative form is specific for Chlamydia trachomatis
Cardiac muscle is unique in that it has intercalated discs, regions of contact between adjacent cardiac muscle cells containing aggregations of gap junctions. Such intercellular junctions are specialized for the rapid spread of contractile stimuli between cells, thereby allowing virtually simultaneous contraction of the muscle fibers. 
Amebic encephalitis from the single-celled parasite Naegleria fowleri is quite rare and would have resulted in rapid deterioration within days.
Interferon-α is used for its leukocytic effects in patients with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Kaposi sarcoma, leukemias, and malignant melanoma. Interferon-α can activate some components of the immune response, such as increasing major histocompatibility complex expression and recruiting Th1 helper T cells, and therefore it has antitumor properties. Other treatments for Kaposi sarcoma include local radiation therapy and chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin or paclitaxel.

 Metamyelocytes are increased in leukemias of myeloid lineage, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Patients with CML typically present with higher WBCs in the 20,000–60,000/µL range.
Bartonella henselae is typically transmitted via cat scratch and causes bacillary angiomatosis (in immunocompromised patients) and tender regional lymphadenopathy.
Listeria monocytogenesmay also be transmitted via consumption of unpasteurized dairy products. Severe disease is, however, typically not seen in immunocompetent adults.

S/S: anorexia, malaise, chills, fatigue, night sweats, myalgias and arthralgias; present for months before diagnosis and can remain undiagnosed/chronic. Complications such as osteomyelitis or spondylodiscitis of the lumbar spine, sacroiliitis, and endocarditis which is the most common cause of death in infected patients.  Labs of infected patients rarely show leukocytosis. Patients are typically neutropenic and anemic, especially in chronic disease.
Alkaptonuria> congenital deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase, the third enzyme in the tyrosine degradation pathway. Homogentisic acid builds up in the body and polymerizes to form alkapton bodies. Alkapton bodies deposit to cause dark urine and dark cartilage. Patients also sometimes suffer from arthralgias and decreased joint mobility, but are otherwise healthy.
Impaired renal absorption of cystine can result in cystinuria, which  presents with pediatric nephrolithiasis. 
Elevated homocysteine results in homocystinuria, characterized by premature atherosclerosis and osteoporosis in Marfanoid patient. 
Leucine and valine are deranged in maple-syrup urine disease. 
Abnormally high methionine can result in hypermethioninemia,  and is caused by defects in one of several enzymes that degrade methionine.
Patients with a1-antitrypsin deficiency are also at risk for liver cirrhosis due to the accumulation of misfolded gene products of a1-antitrypsin in the hepatocellular endoplasmic reticulum.
Lateral medullary syndrome, also known as posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) syndrome, or Wallenberg syndrome -> right-sided facial pain and deviated uvula, vertigo, slurred speech, and signs of Horner syndrome. T
AICA supplies the caudal lateral pontine tegmentum, including spinal tegmental tract of cranial nerve V and the inferior surface of the cerebellum. Disruption in blood flow typically causes ipsilateral deafness from involvement of the labyrinthine artery, ipsilateral facial weakness from involvement of the facial nucleus (CN VII), and ataxia
The basilar artery supplies the medial pons. Strokes in this area are particularly devastating as they can cause “locked-in syndrome,” in which the patient is completely paralysed with the exception of vertical eye movements and blinking
The internal capsule, caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus are perfused by the penetrating branches of the middle cerebral artery known as the lenticulostriate arteries. They are commonly involved with lacunar strokes, which can result in pure sensory, pure motor, or mixed deficits.
The superior cerebellar artery supplies the superior cerebellum. Compromise to this territory is most likely to manifest as ipsilateral ataxia
Presence of HDV Ab, the immunoglobulin response to hepatitis D. HDV utilizes the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) through viral complementation. Viral complementation is when a virus lacks a functional protein needed for replication and “borrows” the functional protein from another source. HDV does not contain the envelope protein in its genome; it requires the HBV genome to produce HBsAg for creation of the viral envelope and release of the HDV progeny. Therefore, HDV requires a co-infection with HBV to infect a host. Transmission of HDV includes parenteral, sexual, and perinatal methods. HDV is most likely to present as superinfections in patients with chronic HBV infection, reporting 95% of HDV cases. This is contrary to a co-infection where both HBV and HDV are acutely affecting the patient. This patient is infected with HDV, which uses viral complementation.
Serotonin syndrome (SS), likely caused by a multidrug regimen that includes an SSRI and a "-triptan" medication. TX: includes supportive care; administration of activated charcoal for acute ingestions; and, in severe cases, administration of cyproheptadine. Cyproheptadine is a serotonin receptor antagonist that is administered by mouth.
Pain and numbness in the lateral leg and dorsum of the foot. When asked to walk, Pt raises his affected leg high off the ground, and his foot slaps the ground when walking. Nerve compromised> common fibular (peroneal) nerve
Femoral nerve injury can occur with pelvic fracture, and manifests with difficulty in flexion of the thigh and extension of the leg. 
Damage to the deep peroneal nerve would cause inability to dorsiflex at the ankle as well as foot drop. 
Similarly, damage to the superficial peroneal nerve causes impaired foot eversion and sensory loss over the lateral leg and dorsum of the foot. Proximal lesions to the tibial nerve result in loss of inversion and plantar flexion and an everted foot at rest, not seen in this patient.
Vitamin D can be consumed from plants (ergocalciferol) or synthesized in sun-exposed skin (cholecalciferol). On exposure to UV light, vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is nonenzymatically synthesized in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol>>>hydroxylates in the liver to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol and subsequently to the active form 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol) in the kidneys, which is catalyzed by 1-α-hydroxylase enzyme.
PTH functions to increase serum calcium by stimulating 1-α-hydroxylase enzyme to form more calcitriol, increasing bone resorption of calcium by binding to PTH receptors on osteoblasts, and also directly increasing renal reabsorption of calcium in the DCT. PTH binding to osteoblasts results in increased IL-1 production and decreased osteoprotegerin, and these changes drive osteoclast activation.
Rickettsia species are gram-negative bacteria that cause a positive Weil-Felix reaction but are unlikely to cause unilateral facial muscle weakness and do not cause migratory polyarthritis.
Ligase chain reaction (LCR) is a technique performed on mutant alleles for the purpose of detecting single-point mutations; LCR does not assist in antibody-based detection of specific proteins.
Cisplatin works by cross-linking DNA preventing DNA replication and interfering with cell division. Because the GI tract and hair follicles have rapid cell turnover, these are some of the most likely areas to be affected by cell cycle inhibitors such as cisplatin. The ototoxicity and acoustic nerve damage results in hearing loss. hearing loss>>an adverse effect of platinum-based Chemo Therapy.
Sudden-onset dyspnea, dizziness, and tearing chest pain that radiates to the back in an older patient with poorly controlled hypertension should raise suspicion for an aortic dissection. A pale appearance, bounding femoral pulses, head bobbing, lung crackles, and an early diastolic decrescendo murmur are further suggestive of secondary acute aortic regurgitation (AR). Profound hypotension, cardiogenic shock, and ensuing cardiovascular collapse may develop without rapid surgical correction.
A child presents with vomiting, stool with frank blood and mucus, and episodes of crying. Think: idiopathic intussusception. When the proximal bowel invaginates into the distal segment, it brings its attached mesentery with it, which leads to lymphatic obstruction, swelling, and decreased perfusion of the affected bowel. This produces intermittent, colicky pain in young children
Tetanospasmin travels via retrograde axonal transport, within the motor neuron, to the spinal cord, where it acts as a protease that cleaves SNARE proteins for inhibitory neurotransmitters, γ-aminobutyric acid and glycine, from Renshaw cells. By inactivating the inhibitory neurotransmitters that act on the anterior horn cells to inhibit neurotransmission.
Inactivation of elongation factor is characteristic of elongation factor-2 toxin, an exotoxin associated with both Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. C. diphtheriae causes diphtheria, which manifests as pharyngitis with pseudomembranes in the throat with severe lymphadenopathy, and Pseudomonasspecies typically cause infections  in hospitalized or immunocompromised patients.
Overactivation of adenylate cyclase is characteristic of the heat-labile toxin associated with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and also occurs with cholera, pertussis, and anthrax infections.
Overactivation of guanylate cyclase is characteristic of the heat-stable toxin produced by ETEC, which causes watery diarrhea.
Inactivation of the 60S ribosome by removal of adenine from rRNA is characteristic of Shigella species and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Shigella dysenteriae causes dysentery and can also cause hemolytic uremic syndrome; this is not common but possible. EHEC can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome.
PKU is most commonly caused by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase, the first enzyme in the breakdown pathway for phenylalanine. Phenylalanine hydroxylase converts phenylalanine to tyrosine, and then tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to DOPA. Both of these enzymes require a cofactor called tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which is regenerated by the enzyme dihydrobiopterin reductase.
An absence of dihydrobiopterin reductase yields even more devastating consequences. This disorder is known as malignant PKU. Important biological compounds that are affected by errors in this pathway include tyrosine, thyroxine, dopamine, melanin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.
Patient presents with sudden-onset right-sided hemiparesis and difficulty speaking, which suggest a stroke. Speech is nonfluent and repetition is impaired, but comprehension is intact. This is referred to as an expressive aphasia. Because patient is right-handed, it is assumed that her language center is located in the left hemisphere (for left-handed individuals, there is also a left-hemisphere language predominance). Expressive aphasia, also known as Broca aphasia, occurs with a lesion in Broca’s area, most likely located on the left inferior frontal gyrus for this patient. Due to its proximity to the primary motor cortex, lesions involving Broca’s area also often cause paralysis of the lower face and arm, which explains the right-sided hemiparesis.
Injury to the posterior corpus callosum results in reading impairment, which is not indicated in this patient.
The left superior temporal gyrus houses the Wernicke area, which, when damaged, would result in a receptive aphasia, producing an inability to compose meaningful speech while retaining fluency. This patient is nonfluent.
Right angular gyrus damage results in Gerstmann syndrome or hemineglect, along with difficulty writing, calculating, and planning movements. This patient’s coordination and gait assessment are normal.
The right precentral gyrus is responsible for movement and damage would result in paralysis of the corresponding contralateral area. Hemiparesis would occur on the left side, rather than the right, as in this patient.
Some common adverse effects associated with first-generation antipsychotics include: endocrine manifestations (galactorrhea, gynecomastia); dyslipidemia, weight gain, constipation, sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and QT prolongation.
Physostigmine and neostigmine, both of which are amines, are reversible anticholinesterases. Both compounds act as substrates for acetylcholinesterase, which prevent esterase from breaking down acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction, therefore increasing the amount of acetylcholine in the synapse. Physostigmine is a tertiary amine and has better central nervous system penetration than neostigmine (a quaternary amine). Thus physostigmine is used as an antidote for anticholinergic toxicity because of its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and treat central anticholinergic toxicity (delirium, agitation), as well as peripheral anticholinergic toxicity. Neostigmine has better peripheral action (especially on skeletal muscle). Neostigmine does not cross the blood-brain barrier,but can be used for post-operative and neurogenic ileus, urinary retention, and reversal of neuromuscular junction blockade.
Beta 1 agonists such as dobutamine and isoproterenol stimulate beta 1 receptors, which are Gs proteins that increase adenylyl cyclase. This increases cAMP, then cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which phosphorylates phospholamban that disinhibits SERCA in the cardiomyocytes causing increased heart rate and contractility.
Muscarinic antagonists, like atropine, act at muscarinic receptors, which block M1(Gq) M2 (Gi) and M3 (Gq). Gq proteins increase phospholipase C, which increases diacylglycerol (DAG) to increase protein kinase C and IP3, which increases Ca2+ causing smooth muscle contraction.
Amphetamines release stored catecholamines (norepinephrine.
Beta blockers, such as atenolol, bisoprolol, esmolol and metoprolol, act as beta 1 selective antagonists and may relieve some of the symptoms caused by atropine overdose by decreasing adenylyl cyclase and cAMP, which would decrease heart rate and contractility. 
Crohn disease>> insidious nature of abdominal pain, and non bloody diarrhea.  Additionally, Crohn disease is an idiopathic (likely autoimmune) condition that results in inflammation and may be complicated by the formation of fistulas.  Other gross features of Crohn disease include skip lesions, cobblestone mucosa, and deep fissures. Microscopically, transmural inflammation and noncaseating granulomas are indicative of Crohn disease. Difference bt Crohn disease & ulcerative colitis, in which the inflammation affects the mucosa and submucosa only, with formation of characteristic pseudopolyps (ulcerative colitis)
Major depressive disorder with peripartum onset is defined by the occurrence of at least one major depressive episode during pregnancy or within 4 weeks of delivery.
History of unintentional weight loss, joint pain, and diarrhea, is presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of Whipple disease, which is caused by infection with Tropheryma whipplei.  Histologic findings are notable for these foamy macrophages crowding the lamina propria with periodic acid–Schiff-positive granules are seen. 
Early manifestations of Whipple disease usually include migratory arthralgia that affects the large joints. Because the disease is relatively rare compared with other disorders affecting the joints, up to 50% of affected individuals are misdiagnosed and treated for suspected seronegative inflammatory arthritis. Later in the disease course, these patients develop abdominal pain and diarrhea (watery or steatorrhea) as a result of malabsorption. This can eventually lead to wasting and weight loss.
Celiac sprue is an autoimmune malabsorption disorder, and histologic examination of a biopsy specimen would reveal villus flattening and lymphocytic infiltrate.

Thinning and splitting of the GBM is associated with Alport syndrome.
Nonproductive cough, fever, headache, and malaise, plus late inspiratory crackles. Chest x-ray shows bilateral diffuse patchy interstitial infiltrate>> suggestive of atypical pneumonia. The infectious agent most likely responsible is Mycoplasma pneumoniae. M. pneumoniae organisms do not have cell walls, and their cell membranes contain cholesterol. Therefore culture of M. pneumoniae requires a cholesterol-rich medium for maintaining and building outer membranes, and M. pneumoniae will not appear on Gram staining. Differentiating viral atypical pneumonia from M. pneumoniae can be done through detection of an elevated cold agglutinin titer in the serum. 
Detection of c-ANCA in serum is used for the diagnosis of systemic diseases such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a gram-negative, aerobic, bacillus bacteria. This gram-negative rod is oxidase positive and non-lactose fermenting.

Abrupt standing and Valsalva maneuver each decrease venous return (by venous pooling and increased intrathoracic pressure, respectively). These maneuvers would therefore decrease ventricular volumes and the intensity of the S3 heart sound.
Bupivacaine is a long-acting amide-based local anesthetic that blocks voltage-gated sodium channels and prevents depolarization. MOA of bupivacaine allows greater cardiotoxicity than other drugs in this class. It can produce arrhythmias and hypotension if administered IV. ECG after bupivacaine administration may show dropped beats with a constant PR interval. >>>has a second-degree heart block consistent with Mobitz type II. A Mobitz type II heart block is another cardiotoxic effect of bupivacaine when given intravenously.
Fentanyl is an opioid that functions by activating opioid receptors, and its use is associated with increased risk of neonatal respiratory depression during delivery. Fentanyl is typically used for sedation during endoscopy or oral surgery.
A common morphologic finding in thalassemia is target cells (red cells with a condensation of hemoglobin in the center, giving them a target appearance).
Increased hemoglobin, increased biphosphoglyerate, and increased renal HCO3- excretion are chronic compensatory mechanisms that occur when a person is exposed to decreased atmospheric oxygen (high altitude) over several days, but are less important acutely. Ventilation is increased, not decreased, in response to decreased atmospheric oxygen to compensate for the hypoxia. PaO2 is decreased, not increased, in exposure to high altitude due to decreased atmospheric pressure.

Patients with selective IgA deficiency are asymptomatic, patients are at risk for the development of anaphylactic reactions following blood transfusions or administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). With a history of an allergic reaction to a blood transfusion, the patient likely has an underlying selective IgA deficiency.
IgA deficiency -> anaphylactic reactions following blood transfusions or administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). 
Because IgA patrols mucous membranes, patients with selective IgA deficiency are particularly susceptible to gastrointestinal infections, especially giardiasis.
Paneth cells found in the crypts of Lieberkühn in the small intestine have an immunologic function in clearing pathogens such as C. difficile. Paneth cells release α-defensins (antibacterial and antifungal peptides) as well as lysozymes and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Tx:  vancomycin or fidaxomicin
Brunner glands are found in the submucosa of the duodenum and secrete alkaline mucus that neutralizes acid contents entering the duodenum from the stomach. 
Chief cells secrete pepsinogen primarily for the digestion of protein. 
I cells release cholecystokinin, which increases the secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bicarbonate. 
S cells release secretin, which increases pancreatic and biliary bicarbonate secretion.
Spontaneous pneumothorax > reductions in all lung capacities
An increase in functional residual capacity and total lung capacity is most consistent with a disease like emphysema
An increase in functional residual volume and total lung capacity but not in vital capacity is characteristic of obstructive lung diseases.
Ethylene glycol intoxication.>> central nervous system sedation, high anion gap metabolic acidosis, flank pain, hematuria, & formation of oxalate crystals. Ethylene glycol is present in antifreeze and is converted to glycolic and oxalic acid by alcohol dehydrogenase. Oxalate anions combine with calcium to produce calcium oxalate crystals that obstruct the renal tubules, causing ATN to nephrotoxic injury. TX: sodium bicarbonate
Methanol is found in paint solvent and windshield washer fluid and metabolism of methanol damages the optic nerve. Methanol poisoning would present with visual disturbances.
Sheep are an intermediate host for the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. Once a human becomes infected, the eggs of E granulosus are carried via the portal circulation from the intestinal tract to the liver, where they can cause walled-off cystic lesions known as hydatid cysts.
On ultrasound, hydatid cysts of the liver are typically hypoechoic and often show “eggshell calcifications” at the rim. Chemotherapy > surgery, because rupture will cause anaphylactic shock.
Amebae, such as Entamoeba histolytica, are on the differential for hepatic abscesses in immigrants from an endemic area; however, patients with an amebic liver abscess usually present more acutely
Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a cardiac neurohormone secreted from both ventricles secondary to volume overload. BNP promotes natriuresis via 3 mechanisms: By direct action on the renal collecting tubule to decrease sodium reabsorption, increasing GFR by dilating the afferent arteriole, By vasodilation of the vasa recta, resulting in washout of the osmotic gradient. Increased BNP can assist in diagnosing left heart failure. Left-sided heart failure presents with dyspnea, pulmonary edema, rales, left-sided S3 and S4 heart sounds, rust colored sputum, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and elevated BNP/ANP.
Centrally located H1-receptors additionally play an important role in wakefulness in stimulating alertness and nausea/vomiting. 
Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is a key cytokine produced by Th1 helper cells and is a potent stimulator of macrophages. It also has antitumor and antiviral activity.
B lymphocytes may secrete IFN-γ. However, their primary role is to secrete IL-12 and other cytokines for naive helper T-cell differentiation.
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes secrete perforin, granzymes, and granulysin. These substances help to activate caspase, which triggers cellular apoptosis.
Eosinophils secrete major basic protein, peroxidases, and cytokines (eg, IL-1, -2, -4, -5, -6, -8, and -13). These produce a proinflammatory state.
Fibroblasts secrete collagen and elastin in order to produce an extracellular matrix to aid in wound healing.
Macrophages produce tumor necrosis factor-α and several interleukins.
Neutrophils secrete substances such as myleoperoxidase, defensins, and NADPH oxidase, which are all antibacterial.
Zileuton is also an asthma drug that targets the leukotriene pathway; however, it inhibits the 5-lipoxygenase pathway and decreases production of leukotrienes to block their effects. 
Salmeterol causes bronchodilation as a long-acting β2-agonist. 
Cromolyn prevents bronchoconstriction by preventing release of mediators from mast cells. 
Theophylline causes bronchodilation by inhibiting phosphodiesterase.
Montelukast acts as a leukotriene receptor inhibitor and therefore would block the bronchoconstrictive effects of leukotrienes while not affecting their production.

CSF examination in MS commonly shows leukocytosis with oligoclonal banding of gamma globulins.
ALS, a neurodegenerative disease that affects both anterior horn cells (lower motor neurons) and corticospinal tract (upper motor neurons). Consequently, ALS results in a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs, although the deficits may be asymmetric. Lower motor neuron signs (fasiculations, weakness) are frequently the first noticed, with an eventual development of upper motor neuron signs (spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign). It typically affects adults over 40 years of age, with a higher incidence in men than women. Death: Respiratory Depression. 
Demyelination of axons in the dorsal columns and spinocerebellar tracts in the spinal cord occurs in subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, which is also known as vitamin B12 neuropathy.
Demyelination of axons in the posterior limb of the internal capsule would cause contralateral spastic paralysis secondary to disruption of the descending fibers of the corticospinal tract, resulting in upper motor neuron signs.
Neuronal loss purely in the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord occurs in poliomyelitis, resulting in a flaccid paralysis (pure lower motor neuron disease).
Demyelination of peripheral nerves occurs in diseases such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and manifests solely with lower motor neuron signs, such as hyporeflexia and weakness.
A combination of “B”-symptoms (fever, weight loss, fatigue) & a hard neck mass with a t([14;18]) translocation is diagnostic for follicular lymphoma. The chromosomal translocation (t[14;18]) results in upregulation of the antiapoptotic factorBcl-2. Bcl-2, along with Bcl-xL, prevents the release of cytochrome c and stops it from binding to APAF-1 and activating the caspase cascade, which results in apoptosis. In B-lymphocyte malignancies, particularly follicular lymphoma, upregulation of bcl-2 resulting from a chromosomal translocation (t[14;18]) then acts to confer a survival benefit to otherwise dying cells and promotes malignant transformation.
 Upregulation of the cell cycle results from inappropriate activation of the protein coded by c-Myc, a transcription factor that drives cell proliferation.
 TP53 is a cell cycle inhibitor in response to the detection of a DNA error. If repair is not possible, the gene p53 then initiates apoptosis. A mutation in p53 is found in numerous cancers, including colon cancer and B-lymphocyte lymphoma.
 Agonism of apoptosis is carried out by BAX, BAK, and other proapoptotic proteins. When repair of DNA is not possible, these proteins allow the release of caspase-activating proteins from the mitochondria to trigger cell death.
 Constitutive activation of G proteins, such as the RAS protein, is seen in many cancers. Activation of RAS is seen in neurofibromatosis.
 Inactivation of p53 occurs in a number of cancers. p53 functions as a tumor suppressor gene, so loss of p53 confers a cellular state that supports progression to malignancy.
 Lisinopril is an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which cleaves angiotensin I to form angiotensin II. Angiotensin II acts on vascular smooth muscle cells causing them to contract. In the efferent renal arteriole cells, this contraction increases the glomerular filtration rate (see image). Angiotensin II works, in this case, by binding to angiotensin receptor type I, which is a seven-transmembrane domain receptor coupled with a G protein (Gq) that activates phospholipase C. Phospholipase C cleaves phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphonate (PIP2) to form inositol phosphate 3 (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 opens calcium channels, causing an intracellular increase in calcium, and DAG activates protein kinase C. Thus an ACE inhibitor, like lisinopril, will cause decreased activation of Gq and decreased activity of phospholipase C in vascular smooth muscle cells.
In patients with sepsis, metabolismis increased overall due to multiple mechanisms, including high fever and inflammation. In the tissues, more CO2 is being produced because of the increased metabolic rate. Furthermore, due to sepsis; the infection leads to vasodilitation of the peripheral tissue which subsequently leads to less blood flow back to the tissue over time. This results in ischemia and eventually an acidic environment. The additional CO2 enters the RBCs, and carbonic anhydrase catalyzes a reaction with water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), which then dissociates into H+ and HCO3-. The hydrogen ions are buffered by the deoxyhemoglobin, while the HCO3- diffuses out of the RBCs in exchange for Cl-. This is called the chloride shift.
Atenolol is a B1-selective blocker that dose-dependently inhibits myocardium B1 receptors. B1 agonists would have difficulty outcompeting such a drug. As a result, glucagon would serve as an effective treatment by activating adenylate cyclase and thereby increasing cAMP levels by targeting a Gs receptor. This would raise the patient’s heart rate and increase contractility. α1-agonists such as epinephrine may help increase TPR and raise blood pressure; however, they would not increase contractility of the heart. 
Activation of guanylyl cyclase increases cGMP and results in decreased vascular smooth muscle tone (vasodilation). Drugs that activate guanylyl cyclase include nitric oxide and PDE inhibitors. 
Inactivation of guanylyl cyclaseleads to the inhibition of cGMP formation, resulting in vasoconstriction. Such changes would increase total peripheral resistance, but would not increase cardiac output. Gq proteins activate phospholipase C which leads to increased levels of IP3 and Ca2+ second messengers in addition to Protein Kinase C. 
Inactivation ofphospholipase C leads to decreased levels of IP3 and Ca2+ second messengers in addition to protein kinase C.
Cholera toxin enters the cell and constitutively activates the Gs protein through ADP ribosylation. This results in a high level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which activates the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) channel, leading to a large efflux of chloride and other ions into the gastrointestinal lumen. The result is profuse watery diarrhea which can cause severe dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities.
Shiga toxin (seen in shigellosis), which causes bloody diarrhea, high fever, and abdominal pain, cleaves host cell rRNA. 
Bacillus anthracis (which only very rarely causes gastrointestinal disease) produces a toxin that directly acts as an adenylate cyclase. 
Both the diphtheria toxin and exotoxin A (from Pseudomonas) inactivate elongation factor 2, but infection with either microbe productive of these toxins will not cause watery diarrhea.
 An exotoxin produced by Bordetella pertussis permanently inactivates Gi, but infection with this bacterium results in whooping cough rather than watery diarrhea.
Management of acromegaly involves treatment with octreotide, a synthetic octapeptide analog of somatostatin, which is more potent than the natural form. Somatostatin is secreted by the hypothalamus and acts at the anterior pituitary to suppress and regulate basal GH secretion. However, somatostatin is also secreted by the D cells in the pancreatic islets and gastrointestinal mucosa to help decrease gastric acid and pancreatic enzyme secretion. In addition to acromegaly, octreotide is used in the treatment of secretory pancreatic tumors (gastrinomas, glucagonomas, VIPomas) and carcinoid tumors.
Non-coding, repetitive nucleotide sequences (eg, TTAGGG) found on the ends of chromosomes most closely describes telomeres. These regions serve to protect the important coding regions of chromosomes from damage or loss of genetic material. By utilizing a RNA-dependent telomerase, telomeres can extend the length of the chromosome by adding non-coding regions via a reverse transcriptase. Although some genetic material will still be lost during DNA replication, it will only be from the newly added, non-coding telomeres. Thus, the chromosomes can be replicated indefinitely and maintain chromosomal integrity without shortening. 
Stem cells or neoplastic cells constitutively express telomerase, which means non-coding regions are continuously added and DNA replication can continue without chromosomal shortening. However, terminally differentiated cells like neurons or smooth muscle lose expression of telomerase and eventually lose chromosomal integrity. Interestingly, one hypothesis is that aging is the result of decreased telomerase expression, which leads to loss of genetic material from DNA replication and eventually, apoptosis. 
Promoters are ubiquitous coding segments of DNA that initiate transcription. Although they are repetitive sequences (TATA or CAAT), they are not typically found at the ends of chromosomes.
Operons, which alter transcription of linked genes, are not non-coding regions found at the end of chromosomes.
Stop codons are known sequences mRNA that terminate transcription. They would be found on mRNA, not DNA.
Transposons, found in bacteria, are “jump” genes that can excise themselves from one location and reinsert elsewhere (ie, plasmid to chromosome). They contribute to antibiotic resistance by facilitating transfer of genes between organisms. They are not non-coding, repetitive sequences at the ends of DNA.
Removal of a gene sequence (introns) in RNA processing allow alternative splicing, which generates many gene products from one gene. They are not found on chromosomes (which is DNA).
Stimulant laxatives, such as senna glycoside, stimulate peristalsis through enteric nerve stimulation to promote transit time. 
Osmotic laxatives, such as magnesium sulfate, which promote osmosis of water into the lumen, are typically very effective at relieving constipation, but are second line to stimulant laxatives and stool softeners as they have an increased risk of dehydration due to high volume diarrhea.
Peripherally acting opioid antagonists, such as methylnaltrexone, are very effective at relieving opioid induced constipation, but are generally used only in patients who do not respond to other agents.
Guanylate cyclase-C receptor agonists, such as linaclotide, are used for treatment of constipation associated with irritable bowel syndrome, but are not used in the management of opioid induced constipation.
In patients with severe opioid-induced constipation who have failed other medications,increasing chloride-rich intestinal fluid secretion with a chloride channel agonist, such aslubiprostone, can be used to relieve constipation. However, senna glycoside is a stimulant laxative.
Dopamine receptor antagonists, such as metoclopramide, are often used in gastroparesis, not constipation.
Though bulk forming fiber laxatives, which draw water into the intestinal lumen, are often used in management of constipation, they do not have the same mechanism of action as senna glycoside.
Acetylcholine receptor agonists, such as bethanechol, are often used in the setting of postoperative ileus, not in the treatment of constipation.
A Patient recently received a bone marrow transplant, and over the course of several weeks developed a rash and diarrhea. This should raise suspicion for graft-versus-host disease GVHD. GVHD is an adverse effect of bone marrow transplantation, in which alloreactive donor T lymphocytes recognize the recipient as foreign and mount an immune response.
Acute graft rejection occurs when the recipient’s cytotoxic T-lymphocytes destroy the graft within weeks to months of the transplant.
 Hyperacute graft rejection results in vessel occlusion, ischemia, or fibrinoid necrosis,occurs within minutes to hours after a transplant, and does not typically feature rashes or watery diarrhea.
 Chronic organ rejection features donor peptides being displayed by recipient antigen-presenting cells, resulting in interstitial fibrosis, atherosclerosis, and vanishing bile duct syndrome.
Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of osteomyelitis in the general population and should be assumed if no other information about the patient is given. Staphylococcus aureus is Gram-positive, catalase positive, and coagulase positive. Among patients who use illicit intravenous drugs, Pseudomonas aeruginosa should also be considered as a highly likely candidate, but it is still less common than S. aureus.
Busulfan is a cell cycle-independent cancer drug that works by alkylating DNA to form cross-links between DNA strands. When the intrastrand DNA cannot be repaired by the cell, the cell undergoes apoptosis. Busulfan is not the correct answer because the patient is not being treated with a cell cycle-nonspecific medication.
HLA-B27 is associated with ankylosing spondylitis, gonococcal arthritis, and acute anterior uveitis. In the setting of a patient with HLA-B27, distal interphalangeal synovitis would be consistent with a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis.
HLA-B8 is linked to Graves disease, an autoimmune disease characterized by hyperthyroidism.
HLA-DR3 is linked to chronic active hepatitis, Sjogren syndrome, and type 1 diabetes mellitus.
Pt presents with morning stiffness, joint pain, ulnar deviation, and an elevated ESR of 60 mm/hr. These are classic symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is linked to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtype known as HLA-DR4. Type 1 diabetes mellitus also has a strong association with HLA-DR4.
HLA-BW22 is associated with Kawasaki disease, an autoimmune disorder that affects children under age 5 and can lead to cardiovascular complications.
Pt prescribed atropine to treat symptomatic bradycardia comes in with intense eye pain. Given the anticholinergic effects of atropine (eg, mydriasis), eye pain is most likely due to acute closed-angle glaucoma. 
Acute closed-angle glaucoma is an ophthalmic emergency that typically presents as an intensely painful, firm eye with blurred vision that may be accompanied with a headache. Findings include a fixed-dilated pupil, corneal clouding, and conjunctival injection. It is the result of aqueous humor outflow tract obstruction, which leads to increased intraocular pressure. In this patient, atropine antagonizes M3 receptors, which blocks the trabecular meshwork since the angle is being reduced by the M3 blockade. Since the trabecular meshwork is responsible for 90% of aqueous humor drainage, this dramatically increases intraocular pressure. Other etiologies of closed-angle glaucoma include hypoxia from retinal diseases (eg, diabetes), which triggers vasoproliferation in the iris that similarly obstructs aqueous outflow. Treatment for acute closed-angle glaucoma involves iridotomy or medication that decreases aqueous humor production, such as beta-blockers or alpha-2 agonists.
Central retinal artery occlusion typically results from thrombosis of the retinal artery from an atherosclerotic plaque. 
Secondary open angle glaucoma is usually the result of blockage of the trabecular meshwork by cellular debris. This includes white blood cells (eg, uveitis), red blood cells (eg, vitreous hemorrhage), or retinal elements (eg, retinal detachment). 
Uveitis is associated with infections and inflammatory disorders like inflammatory bowel disease.
Hypertensive retinopathy is the result of chronic hypertension. The result is arteriovenous nicking (crossing abnormalities), arteriosclerosis (copper wire), and hyperplasia of vessel walls (silver wire). Other symptoms are from ischemia (cotton-wool spots), and can have areas of hemorrhage and hard exudates. 
Retinal vein occlusion is the result of vein compression by a nearby athereosclerotic plaque.
Krukenberg tumors are malignancies in the ovaries that are metastases from a primary tumor, usually located in the gastrointestinal tract. Patients present with abdominal pain as well as bloating and ascites. Occasionally, patients may also have hirsutism. Histologically, the overproduction of mucin pushes the nucleus to the side of the cell, producing the characteristic "signet ring" morphology of gastric cancer and Krukenberg tumor. 
Hypoglycemia. In the setting of vomiting and recent addition of fruit juice (ie, fructose) to infants diet, PT most likely has hereditary fructose intolerance, a deficiency in aldolase B. Aldolase B is important in the conversion of fructose-1-phosphate from fruit to products that can be used in glycolysis. Therefore a deficiency in aldolase B results in the underutilization of the glycolysis pathway and an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate. Accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate has the unfortunate consequence of inhibiting gluconeogenesis, making patients susceptible to episodes of hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. Other abnormalities include signs and symptoms of liver dysfunction, such as vomiting and failure to thrive.
Class III antiarrhythmics include sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide, and amiodarone. These drugs all have other effects on myocardial cells as well. The effect of blocking voltage-gated slow potassium channels is a prolonged phase I II myocardial action potential, which in turn results in a prolonged effective refractory period. 
Chronic watery diarrhea, hypokalemia (muscle weakness, periodic paralysis), increased gastric juice pH (achlorhydria), and abdominal mass on CT are consistent with a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-secreting neuroendocrine tumor called a VIPoma, which originates from the pancreas.
Increased serotonin levels are associated with carcinoid tumors, which are malignant neuroendocrine tumors that tend to arise in the gastrointestinal tract, the bronchus, or thymus. These tumors may secrete substances such as serotonin, and, when they metastasize, may cause carcinoid syndrome (symptoms include bronchoconstriction, cutaneous flushing, diarrhea, and right-sided valvular heart disease).
 High levels of gastrin are seen in a gastrin-secreting tumor called a gastrinoma. Gastrinomas originate from the pancreatic non-β islet cells and cause Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. This tumor secretes excessive quantities of gastrin (causing hypergastrinemia) and reduces stomach pH by hypersecretion of hydrochloric acid (HCL).
 High levels of insulin are seen in insulinomas, which are benign tumors of the β cells of pancreatic islets. Insulinomas produce large quantities of insulin in the blood and are characterized clinically by the Whipple triad: symptoms of hypoglycemia (eg, tremor, diaphoresis, and confusion), documented low plasma glucose when symptoms are present, and reversal of symptoms upon glucose administration.
 Pheochromocytomas are catecholamine-secreting tumors arising from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla that increase catecholamine levels in the blood and are characterized clinically by episodic headaches, sweating, hypertension, and other adrenergic symptoms.
Pancreatic insufficiency in patients with CF is common due to the defective CFTR channel in the pancreatic ductal epithelial cells, which can lead to accumulation of pancreatic enzymes in the pancreas, and may eventually lead to chronic pancreatitis.
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease that most commonly occurs in the white population. The most common mutation of CFTR protein, delta F508 (class II) is on chromosome 7 and is found in approximately 70% of patients with CF worldwide. It is a deletion of three nucleotides for phenylalanine (hence, the F) at positions 507 and 508 (hence, the 508) of the CFTR gene, which causes misfolding that prevents the product's movement from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus (cell trafficking). 
history of an intrauterine device (IUD) placed 3years ago, which is likely the cause of her symptoms, resulting in endometritis. 
Endometritis is the inflammation of the endometrium of the uterus. This condition is associated with retained products of conception after delivery, miscarriage, or abortion. However, it can also be caused by foreign objects in the uterus, such as an IUD. The retained material in the uterus promotes infection by bacterial flora from the vagina. The bacteria most commonly associated with endometritis are Ureaplasma, Gardnerella, group B strep, and Chlamydia. Chronic endometritis is characterized by the presence of plasma cells in the stroma.
Clozapine is considered atypical because it blocks serotonin receptors, in addition to the dopamine blockade common to all typical antipsychotics. This dual action may be useful in the treatment of the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
 Inhibition of both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake is mediated by SNRIs and TCAs
 Dopamine receptors are blocked by typical antipsychotics
 Inhibition of selective serotonin reuptake is not a mechanism used for the treatment of schizophrenia.

Increased frequency of chloride channel opening is the mechanism of benzodiazepines, which are used for treating seizures and anxiety.
Enfuvirtide is an antiretroviral medication that works by preventing entry of viral particles into the target host cells.
HIV enters the host cell by binding its viral envelope glycoprotein (gp120) to the host cell′s CD4 glycoprotein. This interaction induces a conformational change in gp120. The altered gp120 then binds the host cell′s co-receptor, CXCR4 (on T cells), or CCR5 (on T cells and macrophages). Another viral envelope glycoprotein (gp41) is brought closer to the host cell, and it then mediates the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell′s lipid membrane. Entry inhibitors may act either by blocking the interaction between gp120 and CD4 or by interfering with gp41-mediated fusion.
Blocking incorporation of the viral genome into the host cell genome is the mechanism of action of integrase inhibitors, a newer class of antiretroviral drugs.
Saquinavir works by  interfering with posttranslational processing of viral proteins.
Reverse transcriptase inhibitors prevent the synthesis of DNA from viral RNA. There are two classes: nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors and non-nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
Cherry hemangiomas, also called cherry angiomas or senile hemangiomas, are benign vascular tumors (ie, hemangiomas). These papules usually develop in the third or fourth decade of life and increase in prevalence with advancing age
Kaposi sarcoma is a malignant skin condition that presents with violaceous plaques in the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, or respiratory tract. It is often seen in patients with HIV/AIDS.
A strawberry hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor also known as infantile hemangioma or capillary hemangioma. These lesions are most commonly found in infants and children. Strawberry hemangiomas enlarge rapidly and most regress spontaneously by eight years of age. They are bright red to violaceous in color and may be found anywhere on the skin.
An angiosarcoma is an uncommon, aggressive malignancy of the blood vessels that presents on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the head, neck and breasts. It typically presents in elderly patients.
Bacillary angiomatosis presents with capillary skin papules or plaques caused by Bartonella henselae. These lesions are typically seen in immunocompromised patients (ie, HIV/AIDS) and should be treated before life-threatening complications arise.
Pyogenic granuloma is a benign vascular tumor found on the skin and mucosa with a predilection for the gingiva. These lesions are polypoid lobulated capillary tumors that arise in the setting of trauma or hormonal imbalance (ie, pregnancy).
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+/NADH) is not involved in the hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt. It is easily confused with NADP+/NADPH, which is involved in the HMP shunt.
Glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) is the first intermediate in the HMP shunt. Individuals with G6PD deficiency have a reduced ability to use this as a substrate in the HMP shunt, so G6P would be increased in this patient.
Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate is a crucial precursor for purine nucleotides and may be decreased in patients with G6PD deficiency. However, it does not have clinically significant effects and would not be responsible for this patient’s presentation.
Reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide, are produced by oxidizing agents such as sulfa drugs and would most likely be elevated, not underproduced, in this patient’s drug reaction.
Leishmania donovani, which is transmitted by the sandfly. Visceral leishmaniasis presents with kala azar, hepatosplenomegaly, malaise, pancytopenia, and weight loss. "Kala azar" or "black disease" is the gray discoloration of the skin of the hands, feet, abdomen, and face. Microscopically, macrophages containing amastigotes are observed, as shown in the image. Sodium stibogluconate is used to treat L. donovani infections.
The Aedes mosquito spreads the flaviviruses responsible for dengue fever and yellow fever. Dengue fever is characterized by headache, myalgias, arthralgias, and a petechial  rash. Yellow fever presents with fever, headache, back pain, and jaundice. 
The Anopheles mosquito transmits the Plasmodiumspecies of protozoa, which are responsible for malaria. Malaria presents with fevers accompanied by headaches, sweats, malaise, and anemia (due to lysed RBCs), but not leukopenia. It should not cause skin discoloration and hepatosplenomegaly. 
The Ixodes tick transmits the pathogens that cause babesiosis, Lyme disease, and erlichiosis. 
The reduviidbug spreads the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Infection can lead to megaesophagus, cardiomegaly, and intestinal dysfunction. 
Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx commonly arises due to excessive use of alcohol and tobacco. The long-term exposure leads to irritation that causes dysplastic lesions in the mucosa. These lesions have a mutated and overexpressed p53 gene, which allows for unregulated cell growth. Laryngeal cancer can manifest as progressive dysphagia due to obstruction of the esophagus, leading to weight loss. Involvement of the vocal cords often leads to hoarseness. 
Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus usually occurs in the distal third of the esophagus due to long-standing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 
Intussusception>>episodic abdominal pain with nausea, vomiting, fever, and a palpable abdominal mass. No loose or frequent stools. Intussusception>telescoping of one segment of bowel into another, which results in obstruction. Common in children 1–5 years of age. Sudden onset, pain is intermittent ("colicky") in nature & reflects a partial reversal of obstruction and the affected small intestine becoming transiently acontractile.  Vomiting indicates worsening obstruction. Other features >>currant jelly stool and an abdominal mass, which is classically sausage shaped and located in the right upper quadrant. The most common site for intussusception is near the ileocecal junction. Meckel diverticula and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes can serve as lead points for intussusception. Intussusception can be a complication of Henoch-Schonlein Purpura, and, in these instances, the obstruction is most likely ileoileal. Intussusception is a medical emergency, and air enema is used for both diagnosis and treatment. In cases with intestinal perforation, surgery is indicated.
Carbamazepine is an antiepileptic drug that inactivates sodium channels and inhibits N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Its adverse effects include liver toxicity, diplopia, ataxia, teratogenesis, and blood dyscrasias, such as agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia
 Increasing GABA action is the mechanism of action of topiramate. 
Blocking T-type calcium channels is the mechanism of ethosuximide
Increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening is the mechanism of lorazepam, a benzodiazepine used to treat status epilepticus. 
Prolonging chloride channel opening in GABAA receptors in the mechanism of barbiturates.
Von Hippel-Lindau disease, AD disorder >> abnormal blood vessel growth. The overgrowth of blood vessels leads to angiomas and hemangioblastomas in the retina, brain, and spinal cord, as well as in other regions of the body. Patients also show cystic growths in the kidneys and pancreas, pheochromocytomas, islet cell tumors, and clear-cell renal carcinoma. The disease is due to a loss of function mutation in the VHL tumor suppressor gene on the short arm of chromosome 3. According to the ”two-hit hypothesis,” tumor suppressor genes require the loss of function of both alleles to cause expression of the disease.
Broca’s aphasia: comprehension intact, expressive aphasia – frustrated patient; inferior frontal lobe
Wernicke’s aphasia: fluent aphasia; comprehension not intact. Pt is oblivious to their gibberish. Superior temporal lobe
Haloperidol, which is used to treat schizophrenia, is a typical antipsychotic that is a dopamine antagonist> hyperprolactinemia
Bromocriptine is a dopamine receptor agonist that inhibits prolactin secretion.
 Bupropion is a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor.
 Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor used to treat depression.
 Lithium is used as a mood stabilizer in the treatment of bipolar disorder, and causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, hypothyroidism and tremor.
In patients with asthma, chronic inflammation of the airways leads to increased bronchiolar mucus secretion and smooth muscle contractility. This can result in obstructive lung disease and lung hyperinflation. Leukotriene (LT) C4, LTD4, and LTE4 are bronchoconstrictors. Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (via zileuton) to block leukotriene synthesis and inhibition of leukotriene receptors (via montelukast or zafirlukast) can alleviate asthma symptoms, although these medications are typically not first-line. 
LTB4 is a neutrophil chemotactic agent. 
Cyclooxygenase (COX) catalyzes formation of prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and prostacyclins. 
Prostaglandin (PG) I2 (prostacyclin) and PGE2 are products of the COX pathway.
β-interferon, which can be used to treat relapsing forms of MS via an unknown mechanism.
γ-Interferon is used in patients with chronic granulomatous disease.
α-Interferon is used in the treatment of hepatitis B and C, Kaposi sarcoma, malignant melanoma, and certain leukemias.
Interleukin-11 is used in the treatment of thrombocytopenia.
Interleukin-6 is used in the production of acute phase reactants; although not used directly, inhibitors of IL-6 are use for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rubella is a mild, self-limited illness in adults and manifests with a maculopapular rash which begins on the face and spreads down the body. Often, the rash is accompanied by nonspecific symptoms of fever, arthralgias, and lymphadenopathy. It is one of the ToRCHeS organisms (Toxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, Herpesvirus/HIV, and Syphilis) that can cross the placenta and cause congenital disease
Rubella in the mother presents as - Fever, arthralgias, and lymphadenopathy followed by a rash that spreads from the face down to the rest of the body. In the child of a pregnant mother: child presents with wide pulse pressure and a continuous machine-like murmur (PDA). In normal development, the PDA is derived from the left 6th aortic arch and plays an important role in helping deoxygenated blood bypass the lungs during gestation. This structure is usually eliminated at birth but may remain in infants with some diseases or genetic conditions. An important risk factor for PDA is congenital rubella.
Red spots on the buccal mucosa, a rash that spreads caudally, cough, and conjunctivitis indicate measles.
Chronic skin blistering, tea-colored urine, & elevated transaminases most likely has porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), which is caused by inherited or acquired defects in the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase enzyme. Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase is involved in the heme biosynthetic pathway. In the setting of decreased uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity, uroporphyrins accumulate, causing tea-colored urine and blistering skin lesions on the sun-exposed areas (eg, forearms, hands).  
Different steps of the heme synthesis pathway occur in the mitochondria or the cytoplasm.  Mitochondria are involved in the first and final three steps of the pathway. 
The defective enzyme in PCT, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, is present in the cytoplasm.
Red neck syndrome, which is associated with administration of vancomycin due to a secondary release of histamine. This adverse effect can be avoided by a slow 1- to 2-hour infusion of vancomycin and pretreatment with antihistamines.
Abciximab blocks glycoproteins IIb/IIIa, leading to decreased platelet aggregation. Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is a platelet disorder caused by decreased glycoproteins IIb/IIIa. GT involves the platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor complex, which functions in platelet aggregation by way of fibrinogen, vWF, and fibronectin. Platelet aggregation is impaired when the pathway is disrupted, so that GT platelets attach normally to damaged subendothelium but don’t spread normally to form platelet aggregates. Platelets from patients with GT fail to aggregate in response to the majority of physiologic agonists, such as ADP, thrombin, and epinephrine.
Bernard-Soulier disease is associated with decreased glycoprotein Ib.
 In Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura>> decreased platelet count secondary to an autoimmune anti-GpIIb/IIIa antibodies, which lead to peripheral platelet destruction. 
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a platelet disorder due to a deficiency of ADAMTS13 (a von Willebrand factor (vWF) metalloprotease). It would typically occur in patients who have the pentad of fever, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal disease, and neurologic symptoms.
von Willebrand disease (vWD) is the most common inherited coagulation disorder. Decreased vWF impairs platelet adhesion because vWF is necessary to stabilize factor III in the coagulation cascade.
Actinomyces israelii. A stained sample from the abscess shows branching, gram-positive rods. Tx: Penicillin.
Oxacillin is mainly used for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus
Aspergillus fumigatus can cause bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, lung cavity aspergillomas (“fungus balls”) and invasive aspergillosis. Invasive aspergillosis is typically seen in immunocompromised patients.
Blastomyces dermatitidis is a dimorphic fungus. Immunocompetent patients with blastomycosis may present with a flu-like illness (fever, chills, myalgia, headache, and nonproductive cough) or pneumonia (fever, cough, and pleuritic chest pain).
Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that causes CNS infections such as meningoencephalitis and typically affects only immunocompromised individuals (eg, HIV, hematologic malignancy, and high-dose glucocorticoid therapy).
Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus that affects the lungs and the reticuloendothelial system. Histoplasmosis infection usually leads to a flu-like illness with fever, cough, headaches, and myalgias.
Bleomycin inhibits DNA synthesis by binding to DNA and causing single-strand and double-strand breaks. Bleomycin may be used in the treatment of melanoma, sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and germ cell tumors
Cisplatin is an antineoplastic drug used in the treatment of testicular cancer. Common adverse effects include nephrotoxicity and acoustic nerve damage.
Dactinomycin is an antibiotic with anticancer effects. It works by intercalating into the DNA and blocking RNA polymerase. Its main dose-limiting toxicity is bone marrow suppression
Weight loss, night sweats, and painless lymphadenopathy are indicative of Hodgkin lymphoma. This diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells (frequently referred to as “owl’s eye” cells) on a biopsy specimen. The next step after diagnosis is staging of lymphoma to determine potential treatment and prognosis.
Orthostatic hypotension in the clinical setting is commonly caused by different classes of medications which can alter preload or vasoconstriction. Common medications that can cause orthostatic hypotension include alpha-1 blockers (inhibit vasoconstriction via alpha-1 block), tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, imipramine which have alpha-1 blocking activity, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO), alcohol, and marijuana. Calcium channel blockers, such as amlodipine, can cause dizziness due to vascular smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. 
Vitamin K-dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylase converts glutamic acid residues to γ-carboxyglutamic acid (GLA) residues on clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as proteins C and S. GLA residues bind calcium, which is required to activate the factors. 
Protamine sulfate counteracts heparin overdose, but simply getting rid of the heparin doesn't address the other issues involved in HIT (use direct thrombin inhibitors).
A patient’s physical symptoms are lacking an identifiable physical cause.  Sensation and deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) are intact, there’s no indication of stroke, is otherwise healthy. Sudden onset of motor dysfunction after a conflict (Eg: an argument with his wife) and normal neurologic exam and work-up suggests a somatoform disorder, most likely conversion disorder. Conversion disorder (also known as functional neurologic symptom disorder) mimics dysfunction in the voluntary motor or sensory system. Common presentations include pseudoseizures, vocal cord dysfunction, blindness, tunnel vision, deafness, and a variety of paresthesias and paralyses. Patients with conversion disorder experience involuntary loss of function, usually in response to a subconscious conflict. Labs/examination rule out pathologies. 
High blood pressure and signs of end-organ damage (papilledema, retinopathy) are indicative of hypertensive emergency. Approximately 90% of hypertensive crises are due to primary hypertension. The remaining 10% of hypertensive crises are secondary to an existing condition (secondary hypertension) such as renal artery stenosis due to atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia, chronic kidney disease, or hyperaldosteronism. Such conditions can predispose patients to hypertensive retinopathy,  left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, aneurysm, and acute kidney injury. 
 A flank bruit suggests renal artery stenosis, and in a young woman without atherosclerotic risk factors, the most likely cause is fibromuscular dysplasia.
Drugs used in situations of hypertensive urgency preferentially vasodilate arteries and are short acting. Sodium nitroprusside (increases NO and cGMP) and fenoldopam (D1 agonist) are used preferentially followed by labetalol, nicardipine, and clevidipine. Dosages are tapered over the course of 24-48 hours until a target BP is reached. Immediate, rapid decreases in BP can result in hypoperfusion of the brain because of failure of autoregulation in the cerebral circulation. Long standing benign hypertension can cause hyaline arteriolosclerosis in which fibrin deposition thickens arterioles. Hypertensive crises can cause hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis in which smooth muscle cells in the tunica media rapidly enlarge, causing an onion skin appearance on histology.
Acute organophosphate poisoning, which is characterized by excess cholinergic symptoms of bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, hypersalivation, diaphoresis, lacrimation, blurred vision, and miosis. The lacrimal gland cells contain muscarinic3 (M3) receptors, which transmit their signal via the phospholipase C/phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate/inositol triphosphate (phospholipase C-PIP2-IP3) pathway. Other types of receptors that function in the same way are the histamine1 (H1) receptors of the respiratory tract, α1 sympathetic receptors, vasopressin1 (V1) receptors, and M3 parasympathetic receptors.
A Patient, who has an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is receiving a macrolide antibiotic (azithromycin), a β-agonist (albuterol), an anticholinergic agent (ipratropium), and a corticosteroid (prednisone). His lab test results reveal hyperglycemia (normal random glucose level should be <200 mg/dL), which is likely related to the use of prednisone. Steroids cause hyperglycemia by promoting gluconeogenesis. Of the reactions listed, the conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate is the only one involved in gluconeogenesis. The conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate is catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase, which functions as a regulatory enzyme in the gluconeogenesis pathway. PEP carboxykinase requires GTP and is an irreversible enzyme in gluconeogenesis.
An amniotic fluid index obtained prior to delivery is <0.5 L, a finding that suggests that the ureteric bud has failed to develop normally in the fetus. The permanent metanephric kidneys found in humans originate from the ureteric bud, an outgrowth of mesodermal cells that arises from the embryonic mesonephric ducts. Failure of the ureteric bud to properly form results in Potter sequence, in this case, caused by bilateral renal agenesis
The gubernaculum plays an important role in descent of the testes.
The median umbilical ligament is a fibrous band that forms when the fetal urachus narrows. 
An esophageal anomaly such as tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) would result in polyhydramnios, an excess of amniotic fluid. 
The paramesonephric duct (Müllerian duct) develops into the uterus, fallopian tubes, and part of the vagina in females.
Pt with HIV currently undergoing (HAART) presents with signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis: sudden epigastric pain that radiates to the back, periumbilical bruising, nausea, vomiting, fever, and increased amylase, lipase, and hematocrit. Didanosine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that is part of HAART used to treat HIV/AIDS. MOA is competitive inhibition of nucleotide binding to reverse transcriptase and termination of the DNA chain. It requires phosphorylation to be active. Severe adverse effects include pancreatitis and hepatitis. 
Enfurvitide adverse effects include skin reactions at the site of injection. 
Nelfinavir adverse effects are lipoatrophy, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia. 
Efavirenz can have adverse neurologic effects and somnolence. 
Dolutegravir may produce increased creatine kinase.
If defibrillation fails to convert to sinus rhythm, epinephrine is given followed by amiodarone, according to the advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) protocol.
Insulin acts via stimulation of a tyrosine kinase cell surface receptor that autophosphorylates itself when active.  
Exogenous insulin (ie, injected insulin) lacks C-peptide. Thus evidence of an elevated C-peptide level indicates that a patient's high serum insulin level is from an endogenous source, rather than insulin administration. (The C peptide is a processed part of proinsulin, not present in pharmacologic insulin.)
A late complication of chronic rheumatic heart disease is mitral stenosis that presents with a mid-diastolic opening snap followed by a low-pitched murmur heard best at the apex
Class IA antiarrhythmics, such as procainamide, are commonly used to treat aberrant conduction of electrical impulses between the atria and ventricles, and they affect both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. They block sodium channels and thus slow conduction velocity in the atria, ventricles, and Purkinje fibers. This decreased conduction velocity slows phase 0 of the action potential (AP) and is manifested as an increased QRS duration on ECG. In addition to blocking sodium channels, class IA antiarrhythmics also block potassium channels and increase the AP duration by prolonging the effective refractory period. 
Electrical cardioversion is used to treat arrhythmias in hemodynamically unstable patients, and this patient is not hemodynamically unstable.
Propafenone is a class IC antiarrhythmic. Drugs from this class are typically used to treat supraventricular tachycardias; they can also be used for ventricular arrhythmias.
Mexiletine and lidocaine are class IB antiarrhythmics. These drugs are usually reserved for life-threatening acute ventricular arrhythmias, such as those that occur after a myocardial infarction.
Gemfibrozil is a fibrate used for lipid-lowering that is particularly helpful in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. It activates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, which increases triglyceride clearance. Fibrates are associated with cholesterol gallstones, by reducing cholesterol solubility and reducing bile acid synthesis secondary to inhibition of 7-α-hydroxylase (the key enzyme in bile acid synthesis). Thus, gemfibrozil and other fibrate medications may be responsible for—or contribute to—gallstone formation.
Pravastatin and other statin medications may cause hepatotoxicity and myopathy.
 Ezetimibe may lead to hepatotoxicity or diarrhea.
 Lisinopril and other ACE-inhibitor medications classically cause cough, angioedema, hyperkalemia, and hypotension.
 Niacin is another lipid-lowering medication that raises HDL and decreases LDL and triglycerides. However, its adverse effects include flushing, hyperglycemia, and hyperuricemia.
Microscopic polyangiitis(MPA; also known as microscopic polyarteritis) -  fatigue, muscle pain, unintentional weight loss, reddish-looking sputum, and dark-brown stools. palpable purpura, and biopsy of the lesions reveals necrotizing vasculitis. a small-artery vasculitis that is most common in Caucasian individuals. P-ANCA positive.
MPA, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener granulomatosis), and Churg-Strauss syndrome all fall within a category of small-vessel vasculitis related to antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. 
Patient (2 year old fetus) presents after 3 weeks of fever and weight loss and exhibits pallor, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia (low WBC, RBC, and platelets) These findings are consistent with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), which is confirmed by the bone marrow aspiration, demonstrating hemophagocytes. Hemophagocytes are macrophages that have engulfed red blood cells (RBCs) and lymphocytes. HLH involves the abnormal activation and proliferation of lymphohistiocytes, leading to hemophagocytosis and the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. The immune system becomes overstimulated and can begin attacking native cells in the bone marrow.
Ewing sarcoma usually presents in the second decade of life with fever, weight loss, bone tenderness, and pathologic fractures. Bone marrow aspiration from a patient with Ewing sarcoma show stem cells typical of the sarcoma.
 Neuroblastoma manifests with constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss, pallor, hepatosplenomegaly), hypertension, abdominal pain, and an abdominal mass. 
The first step in hemodynamic management of shock is fluid resuscitation. It alone often provides adequate hemodynamic support; however, if fluid resuscitation is insufficient, administration of vasopressors (drugs which increase systemic venous resistance) and/or inotropes (drugs which increase cardiac contractility) may be necessary. Norepinephrine is the first-line agent of choice in the treatment of hypovolemic and septic shock.

Norepinephrine administration will result in increased venous return to the heart through vasoconstriction in conjunction with increased heart contractility, producing an increase in stroke volume (SV). Because the heart no longer needs to beat as quickly to maintain sufficient cardiac output (CO) (as CO = SV × Heart rate), there is a reflex decrease in heart rate. This is known as the reflex bradycardia effect of norepinephrine. Because norepinephrine acts with greater affinity for α-adrenergic receptors than β-adrenergic receptors, this reflex bradycardia in response to α1-mediated vasoconstriction outweighs any β1-mediated increase in heart rate, resulting in a net decrease in heart rate. In addition, administration of norepinephrine can be expected to result in an increase in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure
In the window phase of hepatitis B infection, Anti-HBe or Anti-HBc IgM will be positive. 
In a patient who was vaccinated against hepatitis B and who is immune, one would expect only Anti-HBs to be positive.
 In a patient with chronic hepatitis B infection, HBsAg and Anti-HBc IgG will be positive. The patient may also have HBeAg if he or she has high infectivity or Anti-HBe if low infectivity.
Anti-HBs suggests prior exposure to or vaccination against hepatitis B; however, the presence of anti-HBc is indicative of prior exposure. Therefore, this patient has recovered from an acute hepatitis B infection. 
 In the acute phase of hepatitis B infection, HBsAg, HBeAg, and Anti-HBc IgM would be positive. 
The upper third of the esophagus is made up of striated muscle, allowing some voluntary control. The middle third of the esophagus is made up of both striated and smooth muscle. The lower third of the esophagus is made up of smooth muscle, which is entirely involuntary. Patients with scleroderma develop dysphagia (usually to solids and liquids) secondary to atrophy of smooth muscle of the lower two-thirds of the esophagus and incompetence of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The wall of the esophagus becomes thin and atrophic and can have regions of fibrosis.
Fibrocystic disease is a benign condition and manifests with diffuse breast pain and multiple bilateral masses, commonly found in the upper outer quadrants of the breast. It is one of the most common causes of breast lumps in women from the age of 35 years to the onset of menopause - Proliferation of the acini may be seen in patients with fibrocystic disease
Central necrosis is characteristic of comedocarcinoma, a subtype of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Comedocarcinoma would present with a palpable mass, nipple discharge, or Paget disease. 
Large cells with clear ?halos? refer to Paget disease, which presents with unilateral eczematous nipple changes. 
Lymphatic involvement is indicative of inflammatory carcinoma, which results in a peau d’orange appearance of the skin.
 Sheets of pleomorphic cells infiltrating adjacent stroma describes the histology of invasive ductal carcinoma. Invasive ductal carcinoma can present as a firm, irregular, and fixed mass; unilateral bloody nipple discharge; and skin changes.
Hypersexuality, hyperorality (fixation on oral exploration), and disinhibited behavior are suggestive of Klüver-Bucy syndrome, a constellation of symptoms that can also include visual agnosia, anterograde amnesia, and decreased emotional responsiveness. It results from damage to the amygdala bilaterally, usually secondary to ischemic stroke. His chronically high blood pressure places him at risk for stroke, a strong risk factor for the development of Klüver-Bucy syndrome. Other causes of amygdala injury include infection (encephalitis) and trauma.
The arcuate fasciculus forms the neural connections between the Wernicke and Broca language areas in the dominant (usually left) hemisphere. A lesion here results in conduction aphasia, in which patients have intact comprehension and fluent (but paraphasic) speech (unlike in Wernicke and Broca aphasia), but are unable to repeat words or phrases.
 Although patients with frontal lobe lesions may exhibit findings that are seen in this patient (hypersexuality and inappropriate speech), a frontal lobe lesion would result in the return of primitive reflexes, such as the snouting, Moro, grasp, and palmomental reflexes.
 Bilateral lesions in the mammillary bodies result in Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a constellation of symptoms often seen in long-standing alcoholic patients with thiamine deficiency. Patients with Wernicke-Korsakoff present with confusion, gait ataxia, and gaze disorders and are at risk for permanent anterograde and retrograde amnesia, as well as confabulation.
 Damage to the parietal lobe, especially in the right hemisphere, results in a profound spatial neglect of the contralateral visual field. Despite intact visual pathways, patients with this neglect are not only unaware of the contralateral side of the world, but are unaware of their deficit (anosognosia)
Fifty percent of Kaposi Sarcoma patients have gastrointestinal involvement, which often presents as mucosal bleeding leading to hematochezia, hematemesis, and/or melena
Heroin and other opiates primarily function by stimulation of µ-receptors in the brain and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. μ-Receptor stimulation is responsible not only for the pleasure sensation derived from opiates, but also for the decreased bowel motility and constipation with which opiates are associated. Narcotic pain medications have similar adverse effects, because they are opiate-derived drugs.
3-month history of chronic cough and throat irritation, is a smoker, and has been diagnosed in the past with hypertension. The biopsy shows the patient’s bronchial lining that consists of several layers of well-differentiated, organized squamous epithelium contained above the basement membrane.
Metaplasia, which is characterized by one differentiated adult cell type replaced by another differentiated cell type. Change is reversible. Normal bronchi are lined with pseudostratified, columnar, ciliated epithelium (with goblet cells). Squamous epithelia in the bronchi are not normal, and are often a sign of environmental exposure and/or irritation (eg, smoking).
Anaplasia is an irreversible change in which cells lose their differentiation. 
Dysplasia is a reversible change in which cells loss some of their orientation, shape, and size in comparison with normal cells in that location. 
Hyperplasia is an increase in the number of normal cells. 
Neoplasia is the monoclonal proliferation of cells in an uncontrolled fashion
Eg: patient history of aortic valve replacement, present’s with fatigue and anemia. Given the schistocytes on peripheral blood smear (see image), the increased reticulocyte count, increased LDH, and increased unconjugated bilirubin, the most likely etiology of his symptoms is macroangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). 
MAHA commonly occurs when mechanical forces shear red blood cells. A common cause to be aware of is the presence of a mechanical heart valve, but calcified or stenotic vessels secondary to atherosclerosis can also cause MAHA.
Patient’s symptoms of acute epigastric pain radiating to the back that is worse after meals, tender and distended abdomen with guarding, fever, and elevated serum lipase levels suggest the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Along with the discovery of milky-white plasma, this young man most likely has type I dyslipidemia, or familial hyperchylomicronemia.
Familial hyperchylomicronemia is caused by a deficiency of lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme found in capillary walls of adipose and muscle tissue. The purpose of lipoprotein lipase is to digest chylomicrons by cleaving triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol that can then be used by nearby tissues. Deficiency of lipoprotein lipase results in the inability to effectively utilize chylomicrons, leading to excessively high levels of chylomicrons and triglycerides in the blood.
LDL cholesterol receptor dysfunction is characteristic of familial hyperbetalipoproteinemia, also known as type II hyperlipidemia. 
Mutations in apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can lead to familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, or type III dyslipidemia & would be distinguished by their xanthomas and atherosclerosis. Inability to effectively clear VLDL particles describes the pathogenesis of both familial hypertriglyceridemia (type IV dyslipidemia) and familial mixed hypertriglyceridemia (type V dyslipidemia).
 An increase in Apo CII is not associated with any of the familial dyslipidemias; however, a decrease in Apo CII can be a rare cause of hyperchylomicronemia.
Vitamin B12 is necessary for the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to Succinyl-CoA. Its deficiency causes increased methylmalonic acid levels, which leads to subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. 
Degeneration of the posterior column of the spinal cord causes bilateral loss of vibration and position sense, gait ataxia, and motor deficits.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency can cause anemia after oxidative stress and presents with Heinz bodies (ie, bite cells) on a peripheral smear. However, G6PD is x-linked recessive so it typically presents in males. Moreover, the anemia is normocytic rather than macrocytic.
Orotic aciduria is associated with a defect in UMP synthase, an important enzyme for de novo nucleotide synthesis. Although it may present with a macrocytic anemia, it typically presents in children as failure to thrive and/or developmental delay.
Eg: Elderly patient presents with stable, well-demarcated pigmented lesions that began to appear in old age. The “stuck on” appearance of the lesions is consistent with a diagnosis of seborrheic keratosis (SK). Sudden appearance of multiple seborrheic keratoses is called the Leser-Trélat sign and can indicate the presence of an underlying gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma (eg, colorectal, pancreatic, liver,). 
Ethosuximide is a T-type calcium channel blocker and is the drug of choice for absence seizure disorder.
Modulating the action of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) is the mechanism of gabapentin, used as an adjunct treatment for partial seizures. 
Blocking voltage-gated sodium channels is the mechanism of phenytoin, used for all types of seizures except this patient’s. 
Increasing the firing frequency of chloride channels is the mechanism of a long-acting benzodiazepines, like diazepam, the first-line agent to treat status epilepticus. 
Blocking reuptake of GABA is the mechanism of drugs like tiagabine, used for treating of partial seizures and anxiety disorders.
A young gymnast presents to the emergency department after landing awkwardly on her ankle upon dismounting from the uneven bars. This patient has a lateral ankle sprain, which is most often due to inversion of a plantar-flexed foot, as in this vignette. It is common to have ecchymosis and tenderness over the lateral aspect of the joint. Over-inversion stresses the ligaments on the lateral side of the ankle. As shown in the diagram, these include the anterior and posterior talofibular ligaments as well as the calcaneofibular ligament. Injuries to the ligaments about the ankle usually result from inversion and internal rotation of the foot combined with ankle plantar flexion. The most common ankle sprains involve only the anterior talofibular ligament.
With complete disruption of the anterior talofibular ligament, forward displacement of the talus in the ankle mortise is present. Inversion ankle sprains are more common than eversion injuries; therefore, the anterior talofibular ligament is the most frequently torn. There is usually a predictable pattern of injury involving the anterior talofibular ligament followed by the calcaneofibular ligament and the posterior talofibular ligament. The anterior talofibular ligament is a high-yield anatomic landmark for the USMLE.
Both obstructive and restrictive lung diseases can result in a decrease in vital capacity (VC) due to an insufficient amount of air for exhalation or inhalation. Patients with obstructive lung disease have a reduced ability to expire air, and patients with restrictive lung disease have a reduced ability to inspire air.
Atrial flutter is a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). It is an increase in the rate of contraction that originate above the ventricles. β-Blockers can be used to slow the heart rate in SVT; they are a third-line treatment, after vagal maneuvers and adenosine, for acute SVT. 
For chronic SVT, β-blockers or class IC/III antiarrhythmics are alternatives to catheter ablation, which is the preferred treatment. Catheter ablation is performed to selectively destroy foci of aberrant electrical activity in the atria that generate the flutter current.
Q:  administer metoprolol or esmolol for the SVT & why? Esmolol FIRST because it has a half-life of 9 minutes and is also used in hypertensive emergencies. The ultra-short half-life of esmolol makes it an impractical choice for long-term treatment for this patient's atrial flutter. However, esmolol serves an important role as trial therapy to ensure that the patient can tolerate β-blocker therapy (if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable, the effects of esmolol will wear off within minutes.) An esmolol trial is particulary important in patients with comorbid cardiac conditions, such as myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure. If this patient tolerates the esmolol trial, it is safe to start him on a cardioselective β-blocker with a longer half-life.
A patient presents with weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea, a palpable periumbilical node, and left supraclavicular adenopathy>> diagnosis of gastric cancer. S/S: abdominal pain, anorexia, early satiety, nausea, and/or dysphagia. Weight loss tends to be secondary to insufficient food intake, but may also be due to gastric stasis or outlet obstruction. Ab pain progressively worsens as disease spreads. Lymphatic spread is common. Exam findings may show a periumbilical nodule (called Sister Mary Joseph node) as well as left supraclavicular adenopathy (Virchow node). Patients may also develop anemia; local invasion into the duodenum, pancreas, and retroperitoneum is characteristic of gastric cancer.
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically presents with painless jaundice
Esophageal carcinoma patients would have dysphagia as their most bothersome symptom. 
Krukenberg tumors are characterized by symptoms of abdominal bloating and pelvic and abdominal pain.
Kawasaki disease>>cracked lips, high fever, and conjunctivitis. KD is an acute, self-limiting disease that affects infants and children, especially those of Asian descent. Characterized by acute, necrotizing vasculitis of medium-sized vessels. Kawasaki disease manifests with high fever, congested nonpurulent conjunctivae, and changes in lips/oral mucosa ("strawberry tongue). Patients may also have a desquamating and non-vesicular rash and lymphadenitis. Coronary aneurysms are a feared complication of this disease.
Decreased sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct occurs in response to atrial natriuretic factor release by the cardiac myocytes in response to increased atrial pressure. 
Decreased activity of the thick ascending limb would lead to a decrease in water reabsorption and urine concentration.
 Increased potassium in the collecting duct is the mechanism of aldosterone, which increases sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. 
Increased calcium+ reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule is the mechanism of parathyroid hormone, which does not affect water or sodium reabsorption to such a large extent.
Diluted plasma, hyponatremia, and inappropriately concentrated urine are suggestive of SIADH. SIADH involves secretion of excessive quantities of ADH (vasopressin) from the posterior pituitary. There are many etiologies, including ectopic production by a neoplasm, drug-associated SIADH, and head trauma. 
ADH is produced by the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalmus. It stimulates water reabsorption by increasing the number of aquaporins inserted in the luminal membrane of principal cells of the collecting ducts of nephrons. Excessive secretion of ADH thus causes inappropriate reabsorption of water, diluting the extracellular fluid of the body, resulting in the presenting symptoms and laboratory results.
Activation of κ receptors , which is also precipitated by opioid abuse, causes symptoms of dysphoria, hallucinations, miosis, analgesia, and sedation, but not respiratory depression. 
Inhibition of GABAA receptors by flumazenil leads to hypoventilation, convulsions, blurred vision, tinnitus, and diaphoresis. 
Activation of GABAA receptors, as by barbiturates and benzodiazepines, leads to sedation, muscle relaxation, respiratory depression, hypotension, nausea, blurred vision, and coma.
Atropine inhibits muscarinic receptors which leads to mydriasis, dry skin and mouth, and constipation. 
Activation of noradrenergic receptors, which is precipitated by use of cocaine, will lead to mydriasis, agitation, and tactile hallucination.
Pemphigus vulgaris, a acantholytic disorder of autoimmune origin that is distinct for its oral mucosal involvement and complete sparing of the basal cell layer. Acantholysis is the loss of cohesion between epidermal keratinocytes; in pemphigus vulgaris, acantholysis occurs due to the presence of IgG autoantibodies directed against desmosomes (macula adherens), which serve as the intercellular connections that bind cells together. The destruction of desmosomes by autoantibodies causes separation of epidermal cells, leading to ulcers of the mouth and skin. It is treated with prednisone.
Gap junctions serve as communicating junctions. They contain hundreds of tiny pores that permit the quick transport of small molecules. As such, they facilitate electrical excitation of cell membranes, particularly in electrically active cells such as cardiac myocytes, where they are abundant in the intercalated discs.
Hemidesmosomes are present in the basal cell plasma membrane and serve to anchor the epidermal basal cells to the underlying extracellular matrix. When autoantibodies directed against hemidesmosomes are present, the disease is called bullous pemphigoid. This can be distinguished from pemphigus vulgaris in that it is less severe and the oral mucosa is not involved. The basal cell layers are primarily affected, resulting in subepidermal rather than intraepidermal bullae.
Intermediate junctions (also called the zona adherens), which often contain actin filaments, are just deep to the tight junctions (zona occludens) and function as structural reinforcement for the cell cytoskeleton.
Tight junctions, also called zona occludens, are located just below the luminal surface of simple columnar cells, where they seal the intercellular spaces so that molecules present in the luminal side are unable to pass between the cells and reach the basal side of the cell. These structures therefore create polarity in the cells, allowing certain gradients and specific transport to occur only in distinct lymphocyte surfaces. Unlike desmosomes, these structures do not serve to bind cells together.
Patients with this condition develop jaundice, kernicterus, and bilirubin deposition in the basal ganglia because of high levels of unconjugated bilirubin. The disease is caused by a lack of uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferase, the enzyme normally responsible for conjugating bilirubin. Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I manifests early in life, as bilirubin quickly builds up in the complete absence of conjugation. It is fatal if phototherapy and plasmapheresis are not quickly initiated to prevent the development of kernicterus.
Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II is a less severe form, which has a later onset, responds to phenobarbital treatment, and does not result in death. 
Dubin-Johnson syndrome is caused by impaired excretion of bilirubin and results in conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. 
Rotor syndrome is due to impaired excretion of bilirubin and manifests with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. 
Biliary atresia is caused by impaired excretion of bile and results in the accumulation of conjugated bilirubin.
 VIPoma, a pancreatic tumor that secretes vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) -> profuse watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, an elevated gastric pH (achlorhydria), as well as CT findings consistent with a pancreatic mass. This hormone is normally secreted from parasympathetic ganglia throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The functions of VIP include increased secretion of water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen and relaxation of intestinal smooth muscle and sphincters.  His severe diarrhea leads to the loss of potassium (hyperkalemia) and bicarbonate (normal anion gap metabolic acidosis), suggested by his low serum bicarbonate.
I-cell disease (ie, bilateral hip dislocation), restricted joint movement, and coarse facial features (ie, bulging, scaphocephalic head with a flat, short nose and bulging neck veins), and corneal clouding are most suggestive of I-cell disease, an inherited lysosomal storage disease. The mechanism of this disease is a defect in N-acetylglucosaminyl-1-phosphotransferase, which plays an important role in cell trafficking by phosphorylating mannose to generate mannose-6-phosphate in the Golgi apparatus.
Endosomes are vesicles that take up extracellular debris and ultimately become lysosomes. Although lysosomes are important in degrading proteins and glycans, the enzyme responsible for trafficking to the lysosome is found in the Golgi.
The rough endoplasmic reticulum is responsible for protein synthesis and some protein modifications, but most enzymatic modifications occur in the Golgi.
The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is primarily responsible for lipid synthesis and detoxification.
The extracellular space (technically not an organelle) is the destination of incorrect protein trafficking in I-cell disease, not the site of improper enzymatic modifications.
The proteasome is a non–membrane-bound organelle responsible for protein destruction.
Patient presents with lethargy and bone pain. Additionally proteinuria indicated by the frothy urine, and his X-ray demonstrates several hypodense, lytic bone lesions. He also has an increase in gamma globulins on his serum protein electrophoresis that is commonly referred to as an M-spike. This clinical picture is strongly indicative of multiple myeloma.

One of the complications of multiple myeloma is systemic primary amyloidosis, in which amyloid is deposited in the mesangium and subendothelial space. This eventually results in glomerular obliteration and end-stage renal disease. Staining of amyloid with Congo red yields apple-green birefringence.
Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) causes destruction of glomeruli with crescents of proliferating cells adherent to Bowman capsule. RPGN is characterized by hematuria, with renal failure developing over weeks to months. 
A biopsy with these characteristics would indicate focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which occurs in HIV infection, heroin addiction, and sickle cell disease. FSGS can also be due to other events that cause scarring in the kidney (eg, IgA nephropathy.
Minimal change disease (lipoid nephrosis) is characterized by normal-appearing glomeruli under light microscopy, and foot process effacement under electron microscopy. It is common in children 2-8 years of age, has a male:female ratio of 2:1, and manifests with nephrotic syndrome. It can cause proteinuria, but not lytic bone lesions or increased gamma globulin on serum protein electrophoresis.
Ovoid hyaline masses and are typical of Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules seen in advanced diabetic glomerulosclerosis. The most common lesion consists of diffuse glomerulosclerosis with an increase in mesangial matrix.
δ-Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, the second enzyme in heme biosynthesis, is extremely sensitive to inhibition by heavy metal ions such lead
δ-Aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS) catalyzes the first step in heme synthesis and would be impaired in X-linked sideroblastic anemia. However, this patient has signs of lead poisoning (Burton lines).

Porphobilinogen deaminase deficiency results in acute intermittent porphyria, which is associated with abdominal pain and reddish brown urine. The latter is not seen in this patient.
Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase deficiency results in porphyria cutanea tarda, which manifests in photosensitivity and blistering of the skin, neither of which is seen in this patient.
Cystathionine synthase deficiency results in homocystinuria, which is associated with early-onset atherosclerosis and marfanoid habitus, neither of which is seen in this patient.
Arylsulfatase A deficiency results in metachromatic leukodystrophy, which is associated with intellectual disabilities and gait abnormalities. This patient’s presentation and exposure history are more consistent with lead poisoning.
disulfiram-like reactions include chlorpropamide, metronidazole, procarbazine, griseofulvin, and some cephalosporins.
A patient presents with severe pain after sustaining a blow to the posterior of the knee playing football. His knee was originally bent, but now it is extended on the bed. He lacks pulses in the lower leg, and his toes appear dusky. The sensation is also decreased in his lower leg. He most likely suffered a popliteal dislocation, which has interrupted the blood supply to the lower leg by severing the popliteal artery, causing most of his symptoms. Knee dislocation, even when reduced has the same rate of injury to the popliteal artery. If this artery is damaged, it can quickly lead to complications causing amputation of the leg. Posterior knee trauma is the most common cause of injury to the popliteal artery. An arteriogram or doppler study may be necessary, depending on the severity of the injury. The priority is to preserve the limb. Fasciotomy maybe needed if reduction is delayed. 
The posterior and anterior tibial arteries supply the posterior and anterior aspects of the lower leg.  They are more often occluded from blood clots in peripheral vascular disease patients. These arteries are at risk of diminished blood flow in popliteal artery injuries, as the popliteal artery bifurcates into the posterior and anterior tibial arteries.
The fibular artery supplies the lateral compartment of the lower leg. It is more often damaged from tight casts or pressure to the lateral leg, which causes paresthesias and foot drop. 
The deep femoral artery supplies the posterior of the thigh
The common femoral artery supplies most of the thigh and leg. It is an early branch point from the iliac arteries.
A patient presents with ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and confusion, which are symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy. This syndrome is caused by a thiamine deficiency that is most commonly seen in malnourished alcoholic patients. Other clues that this is an alcoholic patient is ascites, likely due to alcoholic cirrhosis. Thiamine, also known as vitamin B1, is used as a cofactor for multiple enzymes, including α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and transketolase.
Δ-Aminolevulinate synthase is the rate-limiting enzyme involved in heme synthesis, and it requires pyridoxine (vitamin B6) as a cofactor. A deficiency in pyridoxine, most commonly caused by isoniazid therapy, can lead to sideroblastic anemia and a cracking/scaling of the corners of the mouth (cheilosis).
 Dopamine hydroxylase is a key enzyme in the synthesis of catecholamines, which convert dopamine to norepinephrine. Vitamin C is required for the enzyme to function. A deficiency can lead to scurvy.
 Homocysteine methyltransferase is an enzyme involved in folate metabolism, in which it acts to convert homocysteine to methionine. Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) is the cofactor for this enzyme. A deficiency can result in megaloblastic anemia and peripheral neuropathy.
 Pyruvate carboxylase is an enzyme in the gluconeogenesis pathway, which converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate, a reaction that is essentially irreversible. The enzyme is activated by acetyl-CoA, and the cofactors are ATP and biotin. Biotin deficiency is relatively rare and is usually caused by total parenteral nutrition without biotin supplementation, antibiotic use, or excessive ingestion of raw egg whites.
A patient presents with a limp, and while standing, his left hip drops and his trunk leans toward the right. The patient shows signs that his gluteus medius and minimus muscles are not functioning properly. Their function is to stabilize the pelvis, abduct the thighs, and keep the pelvis level during walking. The superior gluteal nerve innervates these muscles, and in this patient, it is not functioning. As a child, this patient may have had polio.  

Patients who have polio may experience injury to the nerve roots. In this type of injury, the left hip drops when weight is put entirely on the right leg during the stance phase of walking (as shown in the diagrams). The patient is unable to swing his left leg forward unless he leans to the right; this is called the Trendelenburg gait. In the Trendelenburg gait, the patient leans on the affected side, and the hip that drops is contralateral to the injured nerve, the right superior gluteal nerve. 
Damage to the left femoral nerve will result in an inability to straighten the knee or bend at the hip. 
Compression of the ventral rami of L2 and L3 could cause loss of sensation along the lateral aspect of the thigh. 
Damage to the obturator nerve will cause pain in the groin that radiates down the middle of the thigh to the knee, as well as instability of the leg during physical activities. 
Impingement of S1-S2 nerves can lead to pain, tingling, or numbness in the buttocks radiating down to the lower thigh and leg. 
During early development, the internal oblique muscle (continuous with its homolog in the thorax, the internal intercostal muscles) is pulled down into the scrotum during descent of the testes to form the cremaster muscle -> cremasteric reflex
Tuberous sclerosis can be summarized by the mnemonic HAMARTOMAS: Hamartomas in CNS and skin; Angiofibromas; Mitral valve regurgitation; Ash-leaf spots; Rhabdomyoma in the heart; (Tuberous sclerosis); autosomal dOminant; Mental retardation (intellectual disability); renal Angiomyolipoma (as displayed in the histopathologic image in the question stem); Seizures, and Shagreen patches.
Examples of first-generation (typical) antipsychotics include chlorpromazine, haloperidol, and fluphenazine. Examples of second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics include risperidone, aripiprazole, and clozapine. Hyperprolactinemia is treated with dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine and cabergoline. Bromocriptine is safe, but cabergoline may not be. These treatments can be used but should be approached with caution and frequent monitoring.
A patient’s presentation of small size, jaundice, corneal clouding, hepatomegaly, and vomiting after milk feedings of any kind points to a diagnosis of classic galactosemia. Classic galactosemia is an autosomal recessive inherited disease caused by a deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. Without this enzyme, phosphorylated galactose cannot be converted to UDP-galactose, an intermediate in the eventual conversion of galactose to glucose. As a result, galactose-1-phosphate and galactitol accumulate in various organs in the body, including the central nervous system, liver, and eyes. Long-term consequences of continued feeding with milk include cataracts and intellectual disability. 
Galactokinase converts galactose to galactose-1-phosphate. Deficiency results in symptoms such as infantile cataracts and developmental delay, which are associated with a milder form of galactose metabolism dysfunction.
Aldolase B deficiency causes fructose intolerance, causing accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate. This results in signs of hypoglycemia, jaundice, cirrhosis, and vomiting. 
Aldose reductase catalyzes the conversion of glucose to sorbitol and galactose to galactitol. Increased levels of aldose reductase have been linked to elevated glucose concentrations and diabetic complications.
Fructokinase converts fructose to fructose-1-phosphate. Deficiency results in a benign, asymptomatic condition.
α-Amanitin is a selective inhibitor of RNA polymerase II and III. RNA polymerase II produces heterogeneous nuclear RNA, which is processed into mRNA. Inhibition of RNA polymerase II thus leads to a decrease in the production of mRNA, and cell metabolism ceases due to the lack of transcription and translation. The liver is often the first major organ that encounters the toxin following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.
Helicases unwind DNA at the replication fork.
RNA polymerase I synthesizes ribosomal RNA.
Primase is a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that incorporates short RNA primers into replicating DNA. 
Topoisomerase break and rejoin DNA strands to relieve supercoiling.
Aortic aneurysms and Argyll Robertson pupils are most commonly associated with infection by another spirochete, Treponema pallidum.
Anemia is associated with Babesia, which is also transmitted via the Ixodes tick and should be considered as a coinfection if anemia is present. 
Conjunctival suffusion is unique (among spirochetal diseases) to the spirochete Leptospira interrogans, which can cause liver, kidney, and systemic illness.
The linear pattern present in the patient’s kidney biopsy specimen is diagnostic of Goodpasture syndrome, an autoimmune disease. Goodpasture syndrome is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). This type of autoimmune reaction constitutes a type II cytotoxic hypersensitivity reaction in which  antibodies attack a specific tissue. A linear appearance of the antibodies attached to the GBM, viewed with immunofluorescent microscopy, indicates a diagnosis of Goodpasture syndrome. Renal involvement in Goodpasture syndrome leads to hematuria, anemia, and crescentic glomerulonephritis. This syndrome can involve both the pulmonary and renal systems and can thus present with hemoptysis and hematuria.
A palpable flank mass is characteristic of Wilms tumor or autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. 
Hearing loss is associated with Alport syndrome, which can present with both hearing loss and renal involvement. 
Hyperlipidemia is a characteristic finding in nephrotic syndrome.  
Restrictive cardiomyopathy is associated with amyloid deposition in the kidneys, which can present as a nephrotic syndrome.
The period between disappearance of HBsAg and appearance of HBsAb is known colloquially as the “window period.” While hepatitis B (HB) surface antibodies are being produced, their levels are less than that of HB surface antigens. Therefore, all available HB surface antibodies are bound to HB surface antigens and are undetectable. When these antibodies are produced in excess of their corresponding viral antigens, they will then be detected in serum. Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb or anti-HBc) is the earliest detectable immune response after hepatitis B exposure and is a response to the core protein of the hepatitis B particle. IgM anti-HBc is the sole marker of acute (because it is IgM) hepatitis B infection during the window period. Anti-HBeAg is also present during the window period, but because it can be produced temporarily during acute, or more constantly during chronic infection, its presence is not useful in determining if the infection is chronic or acute.
Hepatitis B core antigens are not detectable in the blood as is it is surrounded by viral capsid proteins and the viral envelope.
Hepatitis B e antigens are not seen during the window period as HBeAg are bound to anti-HBe before the disappearance of HBsAg. 
Hepatitis B surface antigens are not seen during the window period as hepatitis B surface antibodies are binding to available surface antigens. 
Hepatitis B surface antibodies are not detectable until after the window period as all available hepatitis B surface antibodies are bound to antigens.
Wilms tumor is most commonly associated with a deletion of the tumor suppressor gene WT1 on chromosome 11, but deletions on chromosomes 1p and 16 have also been implicated.
Abnormalities on chromosome 4 are associated with Huntington disease. 
Familial adenomatous polyposis is associated with abnormalities on chromosome 5. 
Abnormalities on chromosome 16 can cause adult polycystic kidney disease, and abnormalities on chromosome 22 can lead to neurofibromatosis type 2.
Cold agglutinin disease is an autoimmune hemolytic anemia often associated with a previous infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae or the Epstein-Barr virus. A blood smear often shows clumps of RBCs.
Lead poisoning also causes a microcytic, hypochromic anemia, but a blood smear would show basophilic stippling because lead also inhibits RNA degradation.
Mutations in the β-globin chain are characteristic of sickle cell anemia and β-thalassemia. These diseases tend to manifest early in life, and target cells are visible on a peripheral blood smear.
 A nutritional deficiency of folic acid produces megaloblastic anemia, with characteristic hypersegmented neutrophils and macrocytic RBCs.
Patients with the clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke who are ≥ 18 years old, with symptom onset < 4.5 hours (or < 4.5 hours from last time patient was seen asymptomatic) are treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), such as alteplase. The current guidelines for tPA therapy are shown. A systolic blood pressure >185/90 mmHg is a contraindication for tPA therapy. Patients with a systolic blood pressure >185 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of >110 mmHg should be treated with antihypertensives such as intravenous labetalol or nicardipine prior to starting thrombolytic therapy. If intravenous treatment does not bring the blood pressure into the acceptable range, the patient should not be treated with tPA because the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage may be increased.
PCP develops when CD4<200 cells/mm3 and prophylactic treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is initiated. Initiate highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) when CD4<500 cells/mm3 (or earlier if the patient is motivated). HAART is a combination therapy made up of two NRTI + protease inhibitor/NNRTI (example: lamivudine + emtricitabine + ritonavir/efavirenz). The earlier treatment is started, the lower the risk of AIDS.
This patient is presenting with fever, jaundice caused by an elevated unconjugated bilirubin level, altered mental status, and the presence of schistocytes on a peripheral blood smear. These findings strongly suggest that the patient has thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).

TTP is a disease characterized by deficiency of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) metalloprotease, called ADAMTS13, an enzyme that normally degrades very large multimers of vWF. In its absence, these multimers accumulate in plasma and can promote platelet adhesion throughout the circulation. The formation of platelet aggregates leads to thrombocytopenia. However, because the coagulation cascade is not involved, results of coagulation tests such as prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal. Common causes include drug therapy, HIV, pregnancy, and familial factors, although TTP may also be idiopathic.

The image provided with the question shows schistocytes, a common finding in a peripheral blood smear of a patient with TTP. Elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase and indirect bilirubin are common laboratory findings. The classic pentad of TTP consists of fever, thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurologic symptoms, and acute kidney injury (a fall in GFR). An elevated creatinine concentration would be expected in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI), as occurs in TTP.

This patient presents with ascites, jaundice, spider angiomas, palmar erythema, caput medusae, gynecomastia, and hard and irregular liver on palpation. Ultrasound shows disrupted architecture of the liver. These are all signs and symptoms of decompensated chronic liver failure. The patient also has a previous history of intravenous drug use. This presentation is consistent with liver cirrhosis due to chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). 

This patient’s use of intravenous drugs is a risk factor for developing hepatitis due to HCV. HCV is a type of flavivirus that replicates in the cytoplasm. Viruses of the flavivirus genus are enveloped, linear, single-stranded (ss), positive sense, RNA viruses with icosahedral capsids. Along with HCV, the genus includes, yellow fever virus, dengue virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, and Zika virus, among others. 

All RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm except influenza and retroviruses. ssRNA virus can be positive strand (infectious) or negative strand (not infectious). Since negative strand ssRNA viruses are complementary to mRNA, they must first use viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase to synthesize positive sense RNA to be read by a ribosome for protein synthesis and initiate the infection. Without the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, negative sense RNA viruses are non-infectious. 

Hepatitis B, which is a type of hepadnavirus, replicates in the nucleus. Adenovirusreplicates in the nucleus and does not have any liver involvement. Parvovirus replicates in the nucleus and has a range of manifestations depending on the age of the patient. Hepatitis A virus, a type of picornavirus, replicates in the cytoplasm and causes acute hepatitis.
episodic symptoms of excessive adrenergic agonism(palpitations, headaches, diaphoresis and anxiety) and has high urine metanephrine levels. This is consistent with a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.  Pheochromocytomas secrete hormones such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine, which activate the sympathetic nervous system and may produce diaphoresis, palpitations, anxiety, hunger, faintness, weakness, and numbness around the mouth.

The medical management of pheochromocytoma involves sequential administration of α-blockers first followed by ß- blockers after adequate α-blockade is established. The α-blockers prevent peripheral vasoconstriction while ß-blockers decrease cardiac contractility and heart rate while also inhibiting smooth muscle relaxation of the arterial walls. This inhibition of vasodilation is the reason why it is crucial that α-blockers are administered prior to ß-blockers: if there is any massive catecholamine release, sole inhibition of ß-receptors impairs vasodilation while α-agonism is unrestrained and this results in unopposed vasoconstriction and hypertensive crisis. Medical management is typically not a long-term measure but rather a preoperative adjunct to surgical excision which is definitive treatment. 

Phenoxybenzamine, an irreversible, nonselective α-blocker, is the drug of choice for α-blockade in pheochromocytoma. However, blocking α-receptors can lead to hypotension, as vasoconstriction is impaired. Other adverse effects of this drug include gastrointestinal upset, headache, and inhibition of erection.

Hyperglycemia is associated with steroids, hydrochlorothiazide, and some antiretrovirals, which are not indicated for this patient’s condition. Lactic acidosis, seen with use of metformin, isoniazid, and some antiretrovirals, is not associated with phenoxybenzamine, nor is metabolic alkalosis. Cytochrome P-450 induction is associated with rifampin, phenytoin, and carbamazepine.
ANOVA, compares the mean values of three or more different populations
A patient has a small, firm, nontender, mobile mass in the lower inner quadrant of her right breast that changes in size with menstruation. There are no skin changes, nipple discharge, or lymphadenopathy. This presentation most likely points to a diagnosis of fibroadenoma.

Fibroadenomas are the most common benign breast tumors and usually occur in women who are 20 to 35 years of age. The tumors present as small, firm, mobile masses. On histologic examination, fibrotic interlobular stroma is seen around normal duct and gland structures. Fibroadenomas are frequently single, well-circumscribed, rubbery, and painless masses. They are responsive to hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle and often become hyalinized and can calcify, mimicking carcinomas of the breast on mammography. Diagnosis of a stable fibroadenoma in a young woman is usually followed by ultrasonography; however, a biopsy is indicated if there is any doubt about malignancy or if the mass is growing.

The other histologic findings are indicative of conditions that produce skin changes, nipple discharge, or both—symptoms this patient does not have.

Branching fibrovascular core extending into a dilated duct describes the composition of intraductal papilloma. 
Large cells with clear halos are histologic findings associated with Paget disease of the breast.
Parallel arrays of small, monomorphic cells with scant cytoplasm infiltrating in linesare often associated with lobular carcinoma in situ or invasive lobular carcinoma.
Sheets of pleomorphic cells infiltrating adjacent stroma is a typical histologic finding that indicates infiltrating ductal carcinoma with a radiating pattern.
 Ethambutol is associated with causing optic neuritis, symptoms of color blindness, and changes in visual acuity. 
Bedaquiline is a new agent to treat TB that has mild side effects including arthropathy and headache.

verapamil, a calcium channel blocker that has proven effective in preventing migraines and cluster headaches.
patient’s lightheadedness, dizziness, and fainting when rising from a sitting or lying position suggest that he is experiencing orthostatic hypotension. Orthostatic hypotensionis defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure 20 mm Hg from supine to standing. On standing, compensatory mechanisms normally increase vascular tone to maintain brain perfusion. Blacking out is the patient’s experience when these mechanisms fail. 

The most likely class of antidepressants to cause orthostatic hypotension is the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (eg, amitriptyline). Although TCAs function via blockage of norepinephrine and 5-HT reuptake, they interact with other receptors as well, producing important side effects, such as TCA blockade of α1-receptors, resulting in orthostatic hypotension. Activation of α1-receptors in the vascular smooth muscle causes vasoconstriction. Thus, blockage of α1-receptors can lead to reduced arteriolar resistance and postural hypotension. α1-Receptors are of the Gq class, and blockage of α1-receptors will lead to a decrease in phospholipase C and calcium release. TCAs can also produce anticholinergic side effects (tachycardia, urinary retention, dry mouth) via interaction with muscarinic receptors and sedation via interaction with the H1-receptor. As mentioned above, the side effect profile of TCAs is a cardinal reason why TCAs are avoided in the elderly. 
Activation of α1-receptors is not the correct mechanism underlying the patient’s orthostatic hypotension because α1-receptor activity leads to an increase in vascular smooth muscle contraction. Blockade of α1-receptors, leading to increased generation of cAMP and protein kinase A is not the correct mechanism because it does not pair the receptor blockade with the correct signaling outcome. Additionally, β2-receptor blockadeleads to bronchoconstriction and vasoconstriction, and H1-receptor blockade leads to sedation, none of which are present in this patient.
Patient presents to the emergency department with a presumed fracture of the right femur, as well as long-standing issues concerning bone pain, dyspnea, and fatigue. Her lab findings reveal pancytopenia, proteinuria, and hypercalcemia, which strongly suggest that her fracture is pathologic, due to an underlying multiple myeloma (MM). As seen in this patient, MM can manifest with pancytopenia with anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and a decreased reticulocyte count. Bone marrow is actively suppressed due to the hyperproliferation of plasma cells. A history of bone pain and pathologic fracture is also common, especially in the setting of hypercalcemia. The bone pain is caused by lytic lesions, which release calcium, causing hypercalcemia. 

The patient’s 24-hour urine collection demonstrates proteinuria. Proteinuria in the setting of MM is referred to as Bence-Jones proteinuria, with a major criterion being >1 g of protein in 24 hours. Creatinine clearance helps define the severity of the patient’s renal impairment. Bence-Jones proteins are monoclonal free light chains produced by malignant plasma cells (which are small enough to be easily excreted in the urine).

Other common features of MM include stacked RBCs, also known as a rouleaux formation,found on peripheral blood smears and shown here. Excessive production of immunoglobulins also produces a characteristic M spike on urine electrophoresis. Excess serum proteins lead to hyperviscosity and cause circulating RBCs to adhere to themselves, leading to the rouleaux ("roll of coins") appearance. The most common abnormal immunoglobulin produced is IgG.


Broken and destroyed lymphocytes on a peripheral blood smear are called smudge cells, which are typically seen in the setting of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
 Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by increased circulating promyelocytes and myelocytes, thrombocytopenia, and normocytic anemia.
Microcytosis and hypochromasia are typical of iron deficiency anemia.
Myeloblasts with Auer rods are seen in many types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), including AML-M1, AML-M2, AML-M3, and AML-M4.
 The central venous pressure (CVP) and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) generally correlate with each other and may be low, normal, or high in septic shock.
Naegleria fowleri,which manifests with a rapidly progressing meningoencephalitis that can progress to coma or death within 6 days. The initial symptoms are indistinguishable from bacterial meningitis, including nausea, vomiting, seizures (this patient’s presenting symptom), and altered mental status. Infection typically occurs through swimming or diving in warm freshwater lakes or rivers. When water containing the ameba enters the body through the nose, the pathogen gains access to the CNS through the cribriform plate. Microscopic analysis will reveal amoebas in the spinal fluid. Although amphotericin B has been effective in some cases of N. fowleri infection, the fatality rate for this rapidly progressing infection is over 97%.
 Hypospadias, which results from improper fusion of the urogenital folds during fetal development
The genital tubercle develops into the glans penis and corpus spongiosum in the male. 
The mesonephric duct gives rise to the seminal vesicles, epididymis, ejaculatory duct, and vas deferens in males. 
The paramesonephric duct leads to the development of the Müllerian system, whose derivatives are not typically present in male infants. The urogenital sinus produces the bladder, prostate, and prostatic urethra. 
An insulinoma is a benign tumor arising from the β cells of the pancreas; it causes increased insulin production, leading to repeated bouts of hypoglycemia, which subside with glucose intake.  Diagnosis is made on the basis of a decreased glucose level and increased C-peptide level. Treatment is excision of the tumor.
The α cells of the pancreas secrete glucagon, which opposes the action of insulin. 

The δ cells produce somatostatin, which is an inhibitor of insulin. Increased somatostatin will prevent hypoglycemia.

Free ribosomes synthesize cytosolic, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial proteins and are not involved in glucose metabolism.

The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the site of steroid synthesis and detoxification of drugs and poisons. It is not involved in glucose metabolism.
Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) is an oncogenic virus that causes both adult T-lymphocyte leukemia and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy, also known as tropical spastic paraparesis, involving demyelination. Common manifestations of adult T-lymphocyte leukemia are skin lesions and lytic bone lesions, which can lead to hypercalcemia (as reflected in this patient’s measured calcium level of 13.6). HTLV-1 myelopathy is characterized by myelin destruction within the spinal cord and periventricular regions of the brain. Patients have a progressive course that includes lower extremity weakness, back pain, urinary incontinence, and eventual spastic paraplegia. Cranial nerves and cognitive function often remain intact.
Eg: If a BRCA1 mutation is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and exhibits a phenotypically variable presentation. This is called incomplete penetrance. A mutation may be harbored and inherited by family members, yet its expression depends on the extent of its penetrance. The risk of expressing a phenotype then becomes the percent of penetrance multiplied by the probability of inheritance.
The sensory receptors responsible for transducing the sensation of vibration, pressure, and tension are the large, encapsulated Pacinian corpuscles, which are located in the deeper layers of the skin, ligaments, and joint capsules
Krause end bulbs are sensory receptors found in the oropharynx and conjunctiva of the eye. These structures are involved in sensing cold temperatures.
 Meissner corpuscles, which are responsible for conveying the sensation of light touch, are small encapsulated sensory receptors found just beneath the dermis of hairless skin, most prominently in the fingertips, soles of the feet, and lips. Meissner corpuscles are involved in the reception of light discriminatory touch, not vibratory sensation.
 Merkel nerve endings are nonencapsulated and found in all skin types—both hairy and hairless—and, along with Meissner corpuscles, are believed to be responsible for discriminatory touch.
 Ruffini corpuscles are spindle-shaped, encapsulated mechanoreceptors that are found in the soles of the feet and are responsible for transducing pressure.
A broad-spectrum antibiotic from the carbapenem class, is administered. Imipenem is often coadministered with cilastatin, an inhibitor of dehydropeptidase-1, an enzyme in the brush border of the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidneys that metabolizes imipenem. By inhibiting this enzyme, cilastatin maintains effective serum levels of imipenem and prevents the nephrotoxicity that can be caused by imipenem metabolites. However, renal function must be assessed before administration of cilastatin and imipenem. Eg to TX: pseudomonal pneumonia.
A patient presents with weight loss, signs of anemia, generalized lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly, which strongly suggests a non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Systemic symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma may include “B” symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and drenching night sweats. These symptoms—which can be seen in both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma—are observed in approximately 40% of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and are a poor prognostic indicator. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma often involves multiple lymph nodes, while extranodal involvement is also common. One risk factor for non-Hodgkin lymphoma is immunosuppression.
Neoplastic B lymphocytes are the cells of origin in most non-Hodgkin lymphomas (90% of cases). The subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphomas include Burkitt lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma. Approximately 10% of lymphomas are Hodgkin lymphomas.
Reed-Sternberg cells are CD15 and CD30 positive neoplastic cells in Hodgkin lymphoma, which can present with fever, night sweats, and localized lymphadenopathy, unlike the generalized lymphadenopathy of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Acute myelogenous and promyelocytic leukemia feature increases in myeloblasts.Acute promyelocytic leukemia is caused by a t(15;17) mutation and features symptoms of marrow failure, such as anemia and thrombocytopenia, along with splenomegaly and bleeding from the gums.
 Plasma cells are mutated and overactive in multiple myeloma, which can present with hypercalcemia, generalized weakness, and renal failure.
 T-cell lymphomas such as Sézary syndrome and T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia can present with a mediastinal mass.
The treatment for Septic shock is intravenous fluids and vasopressors, such as norepinephrine. Norepinephrine has affinity for the following adrenergic receptors, listed in decreasing affinity: α1 > α2 > β1. The most troubling problem in a patient with septic shock is the hypotension, so a pressor must be used.
β1 > β2 > α: Dobutamine is a sympathomimetic drug that is specific to β1-adrenergic receptors. The physiologic effects of dobutamine include increasing heart rate and contractility, which would be useful in the management of cardiogenic shock, rather than septic shock as seen in this patient. Because of its limited α1-adrenergic receptor activity, dobutamine would not induce sufficient vasoconstriction.
Central α2-receptor:  Clonidine is a selective central α2-receptor agonist used to treat hypertension
PDE-3 > PDE-5: Milrinone, with affinity for phosphodiesterase 3 inhibition, is an inotropic agent used on a short-term basis in the management of cardiogenic shock.
α1 = α2 irreversibly: Phenoxybenzamine is a nonselective irreversible α-blocker. It is typically used to decrease, not increase, blood pressure in patients with sympathetic crisis (pheochromocytoma). 
Patients suffering from Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome are commonly found to have symmetric lesions in the mammillary bodies.
Depigmentation within the substantia nigra pars compacta is associated with Parkinson disease, which is characterized by a resting tremor, shuffling gait, and slow movements (bradykinesia).
 Lesions of the subthalamic nucleus may cause hemiballismus, which manifests as a unilateral wild flailing of the extremities.
 Neurofibrillary tangles and widening of the ventricles are associated with Alzheimer disease (AD). Patients with AD experience memory loss, but do not demonstrate any obvious physical findings (such as abdominal distention or skin changes).
Although the ovaries are the most common site of ectopic tissue in endometriosis, ectopic tissue can be found in other sites such as the posterior cul-de-sac, also known as the rectouterine pouch where it may cause dyschezia, along with dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia.
Common antacids, such as calcium carbonate, contain polyvalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, and Fe2+), which directly bind levofloxacin and prevent its absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. 
Hodgkin lymphoma is commonly preceded by an infection with the Epstein-Barr virus.
MHC class I molecules are present on the surface of all nucleated cells for the purpose of acting as endogenous antigens to CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In the case of cancerous cells, these receptors signal to CD8+ T cells that these cells have been corrupted and need to be destroyed. One mechanism by which cancer cells can proliferate is by downregulation of MHC I molecules, thus limiting their exposure to CD8+ T cells and their subsequent destruction.
Dry eyes, fever, confusion, facial flushing and dilated pupils are all adverse effects seen with TCAs. Some examples of TCAs include amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and imipramine. Tricyclic antidepressants have many adverse side effects, including anticholinergic effects this patient is experiencing. Atropine is an anticholinergic medication with similar adverse effects. 
MOA:TCAs inhibit the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE). Adverse effects include sedation, postural hypotension, and anticholinergic side effects like tachycardia, urinary retention, and dry mouth. TCAs can also prolong the QT interval. The antihistamine adverse effects of TCAs include sedation, weight gain, and confusion (especially seen in the elderly).
Phenelzine is a non-selective MAO inhibitor. It can cause refractory depression and anxiety. 
Propranolol is a non-selective beta adrenergic antagonist. It can cause bradycardia, AV block, seizures, sleep alterations, and asthma/COPD exacerbations. 
Phenoxybenzamine is a non selective alpha blocker. Adverse side effects include orthostatic hypotension and reflex tachycardia. 
Mirtazapine blocks presynaptic alpha 2 receptors. Side effects of mirtazapine include sedation, depression with trouble sleeping, dry mouth, increased appetite, and weight gain.
Eighty percent of patients with RA have positive rheumatoid factor (immunoglobulin M antibody against the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G). Identification of rheumatoid factor is one of the four criteria for a diagnosis of RA.
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common malignancy diagnosed in children, and only rarely occurs in adults. The blood and bone marrow are filled with malignant lymphoblasts & cells stain positively for CD10, CD19, and CD20. Cytogenetic analysis of this population reveals a t(12;21) rearrangement.
BPH in which include difficulty starting and maintaining a urine stream, feeling as though the bladder is never emptied, having the urge to urinate again soon after voiding, and pain on urination (dysuria). TX: Finasteride. Finasteride acts by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone (a steroid molecule) to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by inhibiting the enzyme 5α-reductase. Normally DHT binds to the nuclear androgen receptors and stimulates mitogenic growth factors that cause stromal and epithelial hyperplasia along and promote development of secondary sexual characteristics (in men and women). DHT, not testosterone, is the culprit behind prostatic hyperplasia because of its slow dissociation from the prostatic nuclear androgen receptor. Inhibiting 5α-reductase, and thus DHT formation, leads to a reduction in the size of the prostate, providing relief of symptoms.
Muscarinic antagonists, such as oxybutynin are used to treat urge incontinence.
Flutamide, which acts by inhibiting the negative feedback of testosterone on gonadotropin secretion, is used primarily in conjunction with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog, such as leuprolide, in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.
Sclerosis of the aortic valve is caused by calcification of the valve cusps from proliferative and inflammatory changesmimicking those that cause calcification within the vasculature.
Antipsychotics, also known as neuroleptics, block the dopamine D2 receptor in the mesolimbic pathway in order to decrease the positive symptoms associated with schizophrenia.  However, these drugs also block dopamine receptors in other pathways. The nigrostriatal pathway is one of the four main dopaminergic pathways in the brain, and it is involved in the extrapyramidal motor loop that connects the substantia nigra to the dorsal striatum. This motor loop regulates background motor tone.

Blockade of dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway causes parkinsonian symptoms of motor impairment such as rigidity, stooped posture, shuffling gait, and tremor. The medications most likely to cause this toxicity are the high-potency antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, fluphenazine, and trifluoperazine. 
Mesocortical pathway abnormalities in this pathway are responsible for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and typical antipsychotics are generally ineffective at treating negative symptoms. 
Blockade of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway typically decreases the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.
Blockade of dopamine in the tuberoinfundibular pathway causes an increase in prolactin, resulting in galactorrhea.
Elevated levels of immunoglobulin in the CSF, particularly IgG, is present in 80-90% of MS patients. The IgG precipitates as oligoclonal bands on gel electrophoresis
CD14 is a common macrophage cell surface marker. It is used as a receptor to detect lipopolysaccharide on bacteria in order to faciliate an immune response.
CD16 is a common natural killer cell surface marker. It is is responsible for initiating antibody-dependent, cell-mediated immunity via the CD16 binding to the Fc region of IgG.
CD19 is a common B-lymphocyte surface marker along with CD20.
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes express CD8, and helper T lymphocytes express CD4. Although targeting CD4 T lymphocytes may be partially effective, it would be more useful to deplete all T lymphocytes with an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody.
Antibodies against CD3 receptors, which are found on all T-lymphocyte types, would remove the cells responsible for graft rejections.
SNoW DRoP -> Southern blots utilize DNA, Northern blots utilize RNA and Western blots utilize Protein.
Nystatin, TX: oral candidiasis; amphotericin B or fluconazole can be used for serious systemic infection. Nystatin kills fungi by binding ergosterol to form pores in the surface membrane.
Griseofulvin is an antifungal agent that binds tubulin, interfering with microtubule function. It effectively treats fungal infections of the skin (such as tinea capitis, corporis, and pedis). 
Acyclovir, an antiviral nucleoside analog that inhibits DNA replication, can be used to treat herpes simplex virus. 
Foscarnet is an antiviral nucleoside analog that inhibits DNA polymerase by mimicking pyrophosphate, which is typically used as a second-line treatment of cytomegalovirus infections. 
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is considered first-line therapy for Pneumocystis pneumonia. It impairs DNA replication by inhibiting folate synthesis.
ACE inhibitors can prevent cardiovascular remodeling in diabetes and CHF, although the exact mechanism behind this phenomenon is unclear. ACE inhibitors, such as lisinopril, lower blood pressure by decreasing levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone, which in turn cause arteriolar and venous vasodilation. Blocking the constrictive effects of angiotensin II on the efferent arteriole in the renal filtration system can protect against damage due to diabetic proteinuria. Decreased levels of aldosterone, however, can lead to potassium retention in the collecting ducts, or hyperkalemia. The most common adverse effects of ACE inhibitors include hypotension, dry cough, hyperkalemia, renal insufficiency, and angioedema. ACE inhibitors are also teratogenic and can lead to fetal renal damage.
Hyperlipidemia and hypercalcemia are adverse effects of thiazide diuretics. 
ß-Blockers can cause impotence.
Statins can cause muscle pain. 
Ototoxicity can be seen with loop diuretic use. 
Seizures, headaches with increasing frequency and intensity, visual deficits, and behavioral changes = meningioma. MRI shows a space-occupying lesion, which on pathology shows whorls of fibrous tissue and concentric calcifications. 
Tumors with psammoma bodies can be remembered by the mnemonic PSaMMoma: Papillary adenocarcinoma of the thyroid, Serous papillary cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary, Mesothelioma, and Meningioma.
Meningiomas arise from the meningothelial cells of the arachnoid and are most often located in the convexities of the hemispheres and parasagittal regions, but may also arise in the lining of the ventricles.
They are the second most common primary brain tumor in adults and are typically benign and slow-growing. Meningiomas are typically resectable and have an excellent prognosis.
Astrocytes give rise to astrocytomas and glioblastomas, which constitute the largest group of primary brain tumors. Low-grade astrocytomas are slow-growing malignant tumors that are typically found in the posterior fossa as an enhancing irregular cerebellar mass. Low-grade astrocytomas are more common in children while high-grade astrocytomas and glioblastomas are more common in adults and carry grave prognoses.
Glioblastomas typically appear as irregular enhancing lesions and may be associated with necrosis, edema, and local mass effect.
Ependymal cells give rise to ependymomas, which are also more common in children than adults and have perivascular psuedorosettes on microscopic examination. Ependymomas are commonly found in the fourth ventricle and may result in non-communicating hydrocephalus. 
Oligodendrogliomas arise from oligodendrocytes. They are benign, slow growing, and rare tumors. They typically appear as large frontal lobe masses with focal nodular calcifications. 
Schwann cells are responsible for myelinating peripheral nerves and could cause a tumor of a cranial nerve sheath. Schwannomas typically localize to cranial nerve VIII and present with hearing loss and vertigo, tinnitis
Patients with untreated Graves disease are also at risk for osteoporosis and thus increased fractures. An increased thyroxine level stimulates bone resorption by increasing osteoclast activity, resulting in increased porosity of cortical bone and reduced volume of trabecular bone. The increased bone resorption leads to increased serum calcium. Increased calcium levels inhibit parathyroid hormone secretion and conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Alkaline phosphatase levels are expected to be elevated because of increased bone turnover. 
Retinoblastoma is inherited in 40% of cases. A point mutation inactivates the RB tumor-suppressor gene on chromosome 13, which encodes a protein that binds to and regulates the E2F transcription factors. When both alleles are lost, the E2F transcription factors are uninhibited and cause the cell to move from a quiescent stage into the synthesis phase. As a result of the mutation she carries in her functioning RB tumor-suppressor gene, the patient is at increased risk of developing osteosarcomas later in life.
Hereditary spastic paraplegia. Hereditary spastic paraplegia is characterized by progressive lower limb weakness and spasticity due to degeneration of the lateral corticospinal tract
The anterior corticospinal tract is involved in controlling proximal muscles (eg, trunk)
 The anterior spinothalamic tract contains nerves that respond to crude touch and pressure.
 The lateral spinothalamic tract contains nerves that respond to pain and temperature.
 The dorsal column includes the fasciculus cuneatus and fasciculus gracilis, each of which contain sensory neurons involved in pressure, vibration, fine touch, and proprioception.
Hypertensive Emergency>Tx: nitroprusside is the medication that should be administered immediately to this patient. Nitroprusside, one of the medications most commonly employed for hypertensive emergencies, is metabolized to nitric oxide and causes potent vasodilation of arterioles and venules.

The current first-line combination chemotherapy regimen for Hodgkin lymphoma in the US is the ABVD regimen: Adriamycin (doxorubicin), Bleomycin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine. The original combination chemotherapy regimen for Hodgkin lymphoma is known as the MOPP regimen: Mechlorethamine, Oncovin (vincristine), Procarbazine, and Prednisone. This regimen proved capable of curing more than 70% of patients and is still used for patients who relapse or have allergies that prevent them from taking the ABVD regimen. Prednisone is a prodrug of prednisolone. Prednisone is an inactive compound that must be reduced to its active form, prednisolone, which has anti-inflammatory effects. The enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. 
Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP) pneumonia>>Tx: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), a combination antibiotic that synergistically inhibits folate synthesis by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthetase. If the patient has a sulfa-drug allergy, the treatment of choice would be pentamidine. 
Penicillins works by inhibiting the transpeptidase crosslinking of the peptidoglycan cell wall. They are most effective against gram-positive organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Actinomyces. 
Tetracyclines act by binding to the 30S-ribosomal subunit and preventing attachment of the aminoacyl-transfer RNA; they are used to treat infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
 Macrolides are a class of antibiotics that act by binding to the 23S-ribosomal RNA of the 50S-ribosomal subunit, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis by blocking translocation. Macrolides are first-line medications for the treatment of pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae, the most common cause of community-acquired lobar pneumonia, and M. pneumoniae, the most common cause of atypical pneumonia.
Fluoroquinolones work by inhibiting topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV. This is the drug of choice to treat urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli, which is a gram-negative bacteria.
The upper two-thirds and lower one-third of the esophagus are drained by esophageal veins and left gastric veins, respectively. Esophageal varices typically occur in the lower third of the esophagus caused by the backflow of blood from the portal vein into left gastric veins. 
Propylthiouracyl for pregnant women with hyperthyroidism; Methimazole contraindicated
Hemoglobin is oxidized to methemoglobin in the setting of G6PD deficiency and oxidative stress. Therefore hemoglobin levels will fall as methemoglobin levels rise.
Oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) participates in glycolysis but is not directly used in the HMP shunt and is therefore not significantly affected in G6PD deficiency.
Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) is decreased in G6PD deficiency because NADP+ is unable to be reduced to NADPH.
Reduced glutathione is severely decreased in the RBCs of individuals with G6PD deficiency. As a result, oxidized glutathione builds up.
Dubin-Johnson syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an asymptomatic elevation in direct bilirubin levels caused by decreased excretion of conjugated bilirubin from the liver. Patients are generally free of symptoms but may experience intermittent bouts of jaundice as a result of an intercurrent illness. Black Liver
The internal oblique abdominal muscle runs from the inguinal ligament and the iliac crest upward and medially to the linea alba, and superiorly on the borders of the lower three ribs. It is the embryological source of the cremasteric muscle, which lifts the testicles closer to the body. The cremasteric reflex of testicular lift is elicited by stroking the inner thigh. This reflex is absent in testicular torsion
The blockage of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and the accumulation of bradykinin account for increased vessel permeability and subsequent edema in the face, lips, mouth, and subglottic tissues, typically without pruritus. This is a well-known adverse effect of ACE inhibitors.

SIBO occurs when there is altered gut motility (eg. CREST syndrome) -> diarrhea, bloating
Pigment Stones occur when there more bilirubin production such as chronic hemolysis in sickle cell anemia or altered bilirubin enterohepatic pathway seen in Crohn Disease. E.g.: In sickle cell, increased efflux of bilirubin into bile. 
FISH can identify specific chromosomal translocations, duplications or deletions using a single-stranded, complementary DNA segment that is tagged with a radiotracer. Fish is highly sensitive & specific and can be used on tissues with low mitotic rates. 
Vancomycin – Common reaction: Read man syndrome. Activation of mast cells and release of vasoactive mediators.  Not a true allergic reaction so Vancomycin can be restarted once symptoms resolve at a slower rate. 
Pseudocholinesterase deficiency – Unable to metabolize succinylcholine, which leads to a large amount of the drug reaching the neuromuscular junction. Heterozygotes may experience double the normal duration of paralysis. Homozygotes can have persistent paralysis for several hours. 
Glucose is transported into the cell via GLUT2 with the help of Glucokinase, for utilization. 
Buprenorphine is a partial opioid receptor agonist that binds with high affinity but has low intrinsic activity. In patients with long term opioid therapy, buprenorphine can displace other opioids & precipitate withdrawal. 
Most carcinomas, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, spread first from the primary site of the tumor to regional lymph nodes via the lymphatics. 
In chronic aortic regurgitation, persistent left ventricular volume overload triggers eccentric hypertrophy which causes a compensatory increase in stroke volume to maintain cardiac volume.
HCM is characterized by increased LV muscle mass & a small LV cavity. Preserved EF & impaired relaxation. 
3 Anesthetics used for induction because of their rapid onset and short action: Propofol, Etomidate, Ketamine.
