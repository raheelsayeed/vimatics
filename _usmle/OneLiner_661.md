The aminoglycoside class of antibiotics—including gentamicin, tobramycin, neomycin, amikacin, streptomycin, plazomicin, and paromomycin—are bactericidal. Aminoglycosides work by irreversibly binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibiting the initiation complex. This causes a misreading of mRNA and blocks translocation. Bacterial resistance to aminoglycosides commonly occurs due to transferase enzymes. This causes drug inactivation via modification (acetylation, phosphorylation, adenylation, etc.).
