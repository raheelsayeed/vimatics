Motor innervation of the palatal arches and uvula is mediated, in part, by the vagus nerve (CN X), which innervates one of the muscles of the soft palate, the levator veli palatini. Deviation of the uvula to one side implicates a lower motor neuron (LMN) lesion contralateral to the side to which the uvula is deviating. So damage to the left CN X leads to right-sided uvular deviation, whereas damage to the right CN X would lead to left-sided uvular deviation.
