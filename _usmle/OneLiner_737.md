Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by both upper and lower motor neuron signs. Lesions of the anterior horns of the gray matter lead to lower motor neuron signs (eg, muscle weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations), whereas lesions of the corticospinal tracts yield upper motor neuron signs (eg, hyperreflexia). The image shows degeneration of the lateral and anterior corticospinal tracts.
