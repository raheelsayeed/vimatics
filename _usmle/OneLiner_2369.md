MHC class I molecules are present on the surface of all nucleated cells for the purpose of acting as endogenous antigens to CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In the case of cancerous cells, these receptors signal to CD8+ T cells that these cells have been corrupted and need to be destroyed. One mechanism by which cancer cells can proliferate is by downregulation of MHC I molecules, thus limiting their exposure to CD8+ T cells and their subsequent destruction.
