### OneLiner

A patient presents with a limp, and while standing, his left hip drops and his trunk leans toward the right. The patient shows signs that his gluteus medius and minimus muscles are not functioning properly. Their function is to stabilize the pelvis, abduct the thighs, and keep the pelvis level during walking. The superior gluteal nerve innervates these muscles, and in this patient, it is not functioning. As a child, this patient may have had polio.
