Minimal Change Disease (most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children). Clues: Generalized Edema following a mild URI, massive proteinuria with no hematuria. Immune disfunction leads to overproduction of glomerular permeability factor that damages podocyte as well as decreased anionic properties of the glomerular basement membrane. Loss of negative charge leads to selective loss of albumin in the urine. Effacement of podocyte foot processes can be detected on electron microscopy.
