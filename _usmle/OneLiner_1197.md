Flucytosine is a pyrimidine antimetabolite that works by inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis. It inhibits DNA synthesis. Flucytosine is first converted into 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which is then converted into 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP: inhibits DNA synthesis) and fluorouridine triphosphate (inhibits RNA synthesis). It is selective for fungal cells because the two enzymes required for its entry and activation (membrane permease and cytosine deaminase, respectively)
