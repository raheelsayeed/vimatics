Stem cells or neoplastic cells constitutively express telomerase, which means non-coding regions are continuously added and DNA replication can continue without chromosomal shortening. However, terminally differentiated cells like neurons or smooth muscle lose expression of telomerase and eventually lose chromosomal integrity. Interestingly, one hypothesis is that aging is the result of decreased telomerase expression, which leads to loss of genetic material from DNA replication and eventually, apoptosis.
