High levels of gastrin are seen in a gastrin-secreting tumor called a gastrinoma. Gastrinomas originate from the pancreatic non-Î² islet cells and cause Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. This tumor secretes excessive quantities of gastrin (causing hypergastrinemia) and reduces stomach pH by hypersecretion of hydrochloric acid (HCL).
