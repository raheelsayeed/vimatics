BPH in which include difficulty starting and maintaining a urine stream, feeling as though the bladder is never emptied, having the urge to urinate again soon after voiding, and pain on urination (dysuria). TX: Finasteride. Finasteride acts by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone (a steroid molecule) to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by inhibiting the enzyme 5α-reductase. Normally DHT binds to the nuclear androgen receptors and stimulates mitogenic growth factors that cause stromal and epithelial hyperplasia along and promote development of secondary sexual characteristics (in men and women). DHT, not testosterone, is the culprit behind prostatic hyperplasia because of its slow dissociation from the prostatic nuclear androgen receptor. Inhibiting 5α-reductase, and thus DHT formation, leads to a reduction in the size of the prostate, providing relief of symptoms.
