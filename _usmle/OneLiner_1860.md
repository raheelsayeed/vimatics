Tetanospasmin travels via retrograde axonal transport, within the motor neuron, to the spinal cord, where it acts as a protease that cleaves SNARE proteins for inhibitory neurotransmitters, Î³-aminobutyric acid and glycine, from Renshaw cells. By inactivating the inhibitory neurotransmitters that act on the anterior horn cells to inhibit neurotransmission.
