Î±-Amanitin is a selective inhibitor of RNA polymerase II and III. RNA polymerase II produces heterogeneous nuclear RNA, which is processed into mRNA. Inhibition of RNA polymerase II thus leads to a decrease in the production of mRNA, and cell metabolism ceases due to the lack of transcription and translation. The liver is often the first major organ that encounters the toxin following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.
