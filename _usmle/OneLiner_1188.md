SVT â€“ Vagal Massage. Carotid sinus massage stimulates the firing of baroreceptors, which then synapse in the medulla, leading to autonomic changes. An increase in firing of these receptors leads to a decrease in heart rate via slowed conduction through both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes as a result of an increase in parasympathetic activity.
