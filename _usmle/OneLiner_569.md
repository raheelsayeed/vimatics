Differentiating cystic fibrosis from Kartagener syndrome on the basis of clinical symptoms can be difficult because they present with the same respiratory features, such as recurrent and chronic sinopulmonary infections and bronchiectasis. However, they have different extrapulmonary features in that Kartagener syndrome is associated with situs inversus, infertility due to immotile spermatozoa, and normal growth. Cystic fibrosis, however, presents with pancreatic insufficiency, male infertility due to the absence of the vas deferens, and failure to thrive.
