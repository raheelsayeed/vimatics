Adenosine works by hyperpolarizing AV node tissue, increasing conductance of potassium and reducing calcium current. As a result, the conduction through the AV node is markedly reduced. Adenosine's extremely short duration of action (15 seconds) also limits the occurrence of its adverse effects (ie, hypotension, flushing, chest pain, and dyspnea).
