Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic index, making toxicity relatively common -> nonspecific signs: nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, confusion, blurred vision, and abnormal color perception (yellow vision), and more severe like cardiac arrhythmias, AV block. Hyperkalemia is a sign of digoxin toxicity as inhibition of Na-K-ATPase increased extracellular K, and intracellular Na-Ca.
