Aldosterone receptor antagonists (eg, spironolactone, eplerenone) increase circulating renin, angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and aldosterone levels and decrease renal sodium reabsorption. Aldosterone receptor antagonists improve mortality when used to treat heart failure and are first line in the treatment of hepatic ascites.
