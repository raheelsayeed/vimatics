Sudden-onset dyspnea, dizziness, and tearing chest pain that radiates to the back in an older patient with poorly controlled hypertension should raise suspicion for an aortic dissection. A pale appearance, bounding femoral pulses, head bobbing, lung crackles, and an early diastolic decrescendo murmur are further suggestive of secondary acute aortic regurgitation (AR). Profound hypotension, cardiogenic shock, and ensuing cardiovascular collapse may develop without rapid surgical correction.
