Because fibroids are estrogen sensitive, they tend to increase in size during menses or pregnancy and decrease in size after menopause. This patient presents with heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), bleeding between periods, and an asymmetrically enlarged uterus. The pathology slide shows a monotonous population of spindled cells with blunt-ended, "cigar-shaped" nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. The cells are arranged in intersecting fascicles causing the nuclei to stream like a school of fishâ€”the classic presentation and microscopic description of a fibroid or leiomyoma. Fibroids are common smooth muscle tumors that usually manifest with multiple masses.
