Macrolides are a class of antibiotics that act by binding to the 23S-ribosomal RNA of the 50S-ribosomal subunit, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis by blocking translocation. Macrolides are first-line medications for the treatment of pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae, the most common cause of community-acquired lobar pneumonia, and M. pneumoniae, the most common cause of atypical pneumonia.
