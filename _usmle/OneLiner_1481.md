Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, is a cofactor for the enzymes prolyl-3-hydroxylase, prolyl-4-hydroxylase, and lysyl hydroxylase, which are responsible for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues of collagen. Hyrdoxyproline and hydroxylysine are important for stabilizing collagen by cross-linking the propeptides in collagen to form its triple-helical structure. Hence, vitamin C deficiency causes many of its symptoms due to improper collagen formation.
