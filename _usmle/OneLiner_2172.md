With complete disruption of the anterior talofibular ligament, forward displacement of the talus in the ankle mortise is present. Inversion ankle sprains are more common than eversion injuries; therefore, the anterior talofibular ligament is the most frequently torn. There is usually a predictable pattern of injury involving the anterior talofibular ligament followed by the calcaneofibular ligament and the posterior talofibular ligament. The anterior talofibular ligament is a high-yield anatomic landmark for the USMLE.
