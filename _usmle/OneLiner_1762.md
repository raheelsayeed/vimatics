Cardiac amyloidosis is the most common form of restrictive cardiomyopathy in the United States and can lead to diastolic dysfunction, rhythm disturbances, and even ischemia. It presents rarely in patients with chronic inflammatory disease (such as RA or IBD) when fragments of serum amyloid A (SAA) protein, an acute-phase reactant, are deposited in the heart tissue.
