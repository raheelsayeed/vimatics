The basic theory of operant conditioning is that behaviors can be modified by environmental consequences through reinforcement or punishment. Reinforcement makes a behavior more likely to occur, whereas punishment makes a behavior less likely to occur. Both reinforcement and punishment can be either positive or negative.
