Cystic fibrosis is not a true immunodeficiency but does put patients at risk of pulmonary disease. Impaired chloride channel function results in poor hydration of mucus in the sinopulmonary system, leading to poor clearance of mucus and bacteria and inflammation. Bacteria colonize this thick mucus and then cause infections. It will most commonly cause staphylococcal pneumonia, not mycobacterial disease, in this age group.
