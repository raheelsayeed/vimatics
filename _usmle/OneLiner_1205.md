Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is a type of ventricular preexcitation syndrome characterized by the presence of an abnormal fast accessory conduction pathway from atria to ventricle which bypasses the rate-controlling AV node. Ventricles start to depolarize earlier, which is evidenced on ECG by the presence of delta waves, widened QRS complex, and short PR interval.
