Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) deficiency results in X-linked agammaglobulinemia, which causes poor immune response to bacterial infections, especially encapsulated organisms. BTK is a cell surface signal transduction protein that signals B-cell maturation. Impaired B-cell function results in poor antibody production. As macrophages are still functional in these patients, mycobacterial infections are not common.
