Exogenous insulin (ie, injected insulin) lacks C-peptide. Thus evidence of an elevated C-peptide level indicates that a patient's high serum insulin level is from an endogenous source, rather than insulin administration. (The C peptide is a processed part of proinsulin, not present in pharmacologic insulin.)
