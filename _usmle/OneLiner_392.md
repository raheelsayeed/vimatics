The SMA & IMA are 2 of the main vessels supplying the small & large intestines & are connected by a pair of anastomoses: the marginal artery of Drummond, which is the principal anastomosis, & the inconsistently present arc of Riolan (mesenteric meandering artery). These anastomoses protect the intestines from ischemia & due to the marginal artery, the IMA is not always reconnected during aortic aneurysm repair.
