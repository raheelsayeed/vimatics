Vitamin D can be consumed from plants (ergocalciferol) or synthesized in sun-exposed skin (cholecalciferol). On exposure to UV light, vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is nonenzymatically synthesized in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol>>>hydroxylates in the liver to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol and subsequently to the active form 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol) in the kidneys, which is catalyzed by 1-Î±-hydroxylase enzyme.
