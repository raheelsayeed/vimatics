Familial hyperchylomicronemia is caused by a deficiency of lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme found in capillary walls of adipose and muscle tissue. The purpose of lipoprotein lipase is to digest chylomicrons by cleaving triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol that can then be used by nearby tissues. Deficiency of lipoprotein lipase results in the inability to effectively utilize chylomicrons, leading to excessively high levels of chylomicrons and triglycerides in the blood.
