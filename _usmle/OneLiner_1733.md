Myeloperoxidase (MPO) generates a cytotoxic chemical (hypochlorite) in immune cells as a mechanism of host defense. Deficiency results in increased susceptibility to infections, similar to CGD; however, patients with MPO deficiency will have a positive (normal) nitroblue tetrazolium test result. Negative NBT test in NADPH deficiency -> CGD
