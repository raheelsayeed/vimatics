Interdigitating areas of pink and red that form the "lines of Zahn" are characteristic of a thrombus, such as a pulmonary thromboembolism. These lines represent layers of RBCs, platelets, and fibrin as the thrombus forms. CT findings include visualization of the emboli and filling defects. Infarcted lung wedge segments may also be seen. This patient has none of these findings on chest CT.
