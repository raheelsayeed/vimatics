A combination of “B”-symptoms (fever, weight loss, fatigue) & a hard neck mass with a t([14;18]) translocation is diagnostic for follicular lymphoma. The chromosomal translocation (t[14;18]) results in upregulation of the antiapoptotic factorBcl-2. Bcl-2, along with Bcl-xL, prevents the release of cytochrome c and stops it from binding to APAF-1 and activating the caspase cascade, which results in apoptosis. In B-lymphocyte malignancies, particularly follicular lymphoma, upregulation of bcl-2 resulting from a chromosomal translocation (t[14;18]) then acts to confer a survival benefit to otherwise dying cells and promotes malignant transformation.
