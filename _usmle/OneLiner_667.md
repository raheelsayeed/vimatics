Tetracyclines reversibly bind to the 30S ribosomal subunit, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. Because the binding is reversible, tetracyclines are considered bacteriostatic instead of bactericidal. In comparison, aminoglycosides irreversibly bind the 30S subunit and are bactericidal. Photosensitivity reaction, is a common side effect of tetracycline use.
