The posterior and anterior tibial arteries supply the posterior and anterior aspects of the lower leg.  They are more often occluded from blood clots in peripheral vascular disease patients. These arteries are at risk of diminished blood flow in popliteal artery injuries, as the popliteal artery bifurcates into the posterior and anterior tibial arteries.
