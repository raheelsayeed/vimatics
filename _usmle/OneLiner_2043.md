Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx commonly arises due to excessive use of alcohol and tobacco. The long-term exposure leads to irritation that causes dysplastic lesions in the mucosa. These lesions have a mutated and overexpressed p53 gene, which allows for unregulated cell growth. Laryngeal cancer can manifest as progressive dysphagia due to obstruction of the esophagus, leading to weight loss. Involvement of the vocal cords often leads to hoarseness.
