Clinically, Hunter syndrome is very similar to Hurler syndrome. Both disorders are mucopolysaccharidoses that are characterized by an accumulation of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. However, Hunter syndrome is notable for the absence of corneal clouding, which is present in Hurler syndrome. Moreover, symptoms of Hunter syndrome manifest between 2 and 4 years of age, while Hurler syndrome is generally diagnosed in the first year of life.
