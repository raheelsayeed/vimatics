The most common site for Acute Compartment Syndrome is the Anterior Compartment of the left which includes the foot extensor muscles, anterior tibial artery, and the deep peroneal (fibular) nerve. Injury to the deep peroneal nerve causes decreased sensation between the first & second toes, decreased dorsiflexion of the foot, foot drop & claw foot.
