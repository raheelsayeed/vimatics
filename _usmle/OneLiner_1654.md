G6PD>X-linked recessive disease making it much more common in men than in women. Symptoms can still present in female offspring of those who are carriers of the disease through lyonization. One part of the X chromosome is inactivated (heterochromatin) and the other corresponding part of the second X chromosome is activated (euchromatin).  If the activated portion of the second chromosome contains mutant DNA, then X-linked recessive diseases can present.
