Abciximab blocks glycoproteins IIb/IIIa, leading to decreased platelet aggregation. Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is a platelet disorder caused by decreased glycoproteins IIb/IIIa. GT involves the platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor complex, which functions in platelet aggregation by way of fibrinogen, vWF, and fibronectin. Platelet aggregation is impaired when the pathway is disrupted, so that GT platelets attach normally to damaged subendothelium but donâ€™t spread normally to form platelet aggregates. Platelets from patients with GT fail to aggregate in response to the majority of physiologic agonists, such as ADP, thrombin, and epinephrine.
