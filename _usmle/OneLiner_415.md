Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a benign AR disorder characterized by defective hepatic excretion of bilirubin glucuronides due to a mutation in the canalicular membrane transport protein. Impaired bilirubin excretion may result in direct (conjugated) hyperbilirubinemia. Grossly liver appears black due to impaired excretion of epinephrine metabolites that accumulate within lysosomes.
