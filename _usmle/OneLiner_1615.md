There is no cure for myasthenia gravis and treatment is symptomatic. Pyridostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used in the management of chronic myasthenia gravis and has a duration of action of 3 to 6 hours. The drug acts in the synaptic cleft by competing with ACh for attachment to acetylcholinesterase, thus prolonging the effects of ACh. Neostigmine is also a acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, but its duration of action is only two to four hours. Thymectomy is first-line treatment for patients with generalized myasthenia gravis.
