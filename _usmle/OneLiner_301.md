Down Syndrome â€“ early onset AD. Involves accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles & extracellular amyloid-beta plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles composed of Tau proteins. Amyloid beta is an abnormal fragment of amyloid precursor protein. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene is located on Chromosome 21. The extra copy of APP present in trisomy 21 is thought to accelerate amyloid accumulation & lead to early onset AD.
