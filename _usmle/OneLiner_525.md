RANK/RANK-L interaction is essential for osteoclast formation + differentiation. Osteoprotegerins blocks their interaction and reduce formation of mature osteoclasts. Low Estrogen cause osteoporosis by decreasing osteoprotegerin production -> increasing RANK-L production and RANK expression in osteoclast precursors
