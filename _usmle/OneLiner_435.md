Digoxin (Cardiac Glycoside) exerts its antiarrhythmic effects by increasing vagal output to the AV node & conduction system. It also increases intracellular calcium in the ventricular myocytes, leading to increased cardiac contractility. MOA: Direct inhibition of Na+/K+/ATPase>indirect inhibition of Na/Ca+ exchanger=increase in [Ca2+]>positive inotropy. Stimulates vagus nerve > Decrease heartrate.
