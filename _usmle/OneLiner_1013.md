ARBs (eg, losartan, candesartan, valsartan) act by blocking angiotensin II receptors. This inhibits the release of aldosterone, leading to volume contraction, as well as prevents constriction of the systemic vasculature. These mechanisms act to decrease blood pressure. Side effects include hyperkalemia and decreases in glomerular filtration rate. Additionally, ARBs are a known teratogen. They are first line in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (eg, diabetic nephropathy) in those intolerant to ACE inhibitors
