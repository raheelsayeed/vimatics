MAOIs prevent the metabolism of all monoamines, including tyramine. This triggers the release of catecholamine stores and further potentiates the pressor effects of high doses of sympathetic amines. Tyramine itself is a vasoactive compound. When tyramine is consumed by a patient who is concurrently taking an MAOI, it is not adequately metabolized, and its vasoactivity can cause a drastic increase in blood pressure and a hypertensive crisis. A person taking an MAOI is also at increased risk of hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome if taken with meperidine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or some tricyclic antidepressants.
