Red-purple partial consolidation of parenchyma is seen in the congestive stage of lobar pneumonia. CT of the chest of a patient with lobar pneumonia would demonstrate diffuse opacities of the lung parenchyma, potentially in a lobular distribution. Other findings include dense consolidations and ground glass opacities. These findings are not seen on this patientâ€™s CT image.
