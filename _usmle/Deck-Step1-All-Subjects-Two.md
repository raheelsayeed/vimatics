### 1. Gap Junctions seen where? 

_gaps connect.._
- Connexon proteins permit Electrical impluse transfers
- Enable coordinated cilia movement
- Cardiac myocytes connected to each other for electrically

### 2. Tight Junctions? where?

_tight occludes and forms barriers_

- claudins and occludins (prevents solute movement between cells)
- damaged by infarction
- Blood-Brain Barrier 
- Blood-Testis barrier

### 3. Adherins --- they are belts!

- Anti Growth signal! 
- connect actin cytoskeleton between adjacent cells
- __CADherins__ (Calcium dependent ADhesion proteins)
- Loss of E-Cadherin promotes Invasion
- Gastric Ca - diffuse type (E-CAD mutation)
- Breast Ca
    - Lobar Carcinoma in Situ
    - Invasive Lobar Ca.

### 4. AKI/Prerenal azotemia? Loss of Blood flow

- Main problem: ischemia, reduced RBF
- __KIDNEY RESPONDS BY INCREASING CAPACITY__ to conserve FLOW
- Decreased RBF --> Decreased GFR --> (response) Increase Reabsorption of Na, Water, UREA --> Less Na excreted --> < 1% FENa, Low Urine-Na <20; Inc Water Reabsorption --> __Increase UrineOsmolality >500__ 
- Creatinine continues to be excreted while UREA is reabsorbed: __>20 serum BUN/Cr ratio__

### 5. AKI/Intrinsic-Acute Tubular Necrosis: loosing absorptive CAPACITY!

- Now we loose absorptive capacity
- Loss of Na --> FENa > 2%, Urine Na > 40; Loss of  Water --> UrineOsmolality < 350; UREA not absorbed -->  Serum BUN/Cr < 15


### 6. AKI: reduces GFR!

### 7. AKI: In Mainteinance phase, there is increased risk of?

- HYPOKALEMIA
- Electrolyte imbalance
- renal wasting
