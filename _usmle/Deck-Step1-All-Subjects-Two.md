### 1. Gap Junctions seen where? 

_gaps connect.._
- Connexon proteins permit Electrical impluse transfers
- Enable coordinated cilia movement
- Cardiac myocytes connected to each other for electrically

### 2. Tight Junctions? where?

_tight occludes and forms barriers_

- claudins and occludins (prevents solute movement between cells)
- damaged by infarction
- Blood-Brain Barrier 
- Blood-Testis barrier

### 3. Adherins --- they are belts!

- Anti Growth signal! 
- connect actin cytoskeleton between adjacent cells
- __CADherins__ (Calcium dependent ADhesion proteins)
- Loss of E-Cadherin promotes Invasion
- Gastric Ca - diffuse type (E-CAD mutation)
- Breast Ca
    - Lobar Carcinoma in Situ
    - Invasive Lobar Ca.

### 4. AKI/Prerenal azotemia? Loss of Blood flow

- Main problem: ischemia, reduced RBF
- __KIDNEY RESPONDS BY INCREASING CAPACITY__ to conserve FLOW
- Decreased RBF --> Decreased GFR --> (response) Increase Reabsorption of Na, Water, UREA --> Less Na excreted --> < 1% FENa, Low Urine-Na <20; Inc Water Reabsorption --> __Increase UrineOsmolality >500__ 
- Creatinine continues to be excreted while UREA is reabsorbed: __>20 serum BUN/Cr ratio__

### 5. AKI/Intrinsic-Acute Tubular Necrosis: loosing absorptive CAPACITY!

- Now we loose absorptive capacity
- Loss of Na --> FENa > 2%, Urine Na > 40; Loss of  Water --> UrineOsmolality < 350; UREA not absorbed -->  Serum BUN/Cr < 15


### 6. AKI: reduces GFR!

### 7. AKI: In Mainteinance phase, there is increased risk of?

- HYPOKALEMIA
- Electrolyte imbalance
- renal wasting

### 8. Intracellular Ca regulation -Sarcolemma Muscle contraction

- Action potential reaches NMJ inside Sarcolemma --> 3Na/Ca Exchanger (Na influx, Ca efflux in the T-Tubule space --> Ca reenters Cytoplasm via L-Type Ca Channel --+> Ca activates RyR2 channel on the Sarcoplasmic reticulum --> Sarcoplasmic Reticulum effluxes its Ca into Cytoplasm through the RyR2 channel --> binds to Troponin C --> Muscle contraction;
- After contraction, Myosin is detached upon binding of new ATP --> Ca-attached-to-troponin C is realeased --> Ca sequestered back into Sarcoplasmic Reticulum through the __SERCA2__ channel

### 9. GFR Autoregulation

- Dec BP --> Dec RPF (Reduced Hyderostatic PRessure) --> Dec GFR --> Dec NaCl @ macula densa:
    - Dec GFR --+> RAAS --> Eferent Arteriole Constriction --> Improved  GFR
    - Dec GFR --+> Afferent Arteriole Dilation --> Improved  GFR
        - Improved GFR --> Inc FF



### 10. Early pregnany loss, Inc risk of complications, prematurity:

- Bicornuate uterus: Incomplete fusion of Mullerian ducts

### 11. Double uterus, vagina, cervix:

- Complete failure of fusion
- __Pregnancy POSSIBLE__

### 12. Viral infection that flares and remits in cyclical fashion: 

- HSV

### 13. CFTR is a problem of pre or post translational processing?

- POST translational
- due to misfolded proteins which are sent to preoteasome-ubiquitin system for degradation

### 14. Carpal Tunnel Sydnrome: 

- MEDIAN NERVE
- Thenar eminence atrophies but spares sensation (cutaneous branch enters hand external to carpal tunnel)
- 90 degree flexion at wrist causes tingling *Phalen*
- Percussion of wrist: tingling *Tinlen*\

### 15. CTS causing Conditions

- RA, Preg, Hypothyroidism (GAGs), DM (connnective tissue thickening), Hemodialysis (b2Microglobulin, amyloidosis)

### 16. Cardiac reaction to decreased o2 delivery:

- Release Adenosin and NO --> Coronary vascular smooth muscle vasodilation --> maintaine adequate perfusion. 
- Increased Pressure? --> reduce Adenosin and NO --> increase vascular resistance --> maintaine adequate perfiusn pressure
- [Adenosine](../Drug_Adenosine_Action/)

### 17. Chest Pain RELIEVED by leaning Forward?

- Pericarditis: acute pleuritic chest pain 
- retroperitoneal things


### 18. a factor, enters nucleous and makes acutephase reactants, cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, leukocyte growth factors

- Nuclear Factor Kappa B 


### 19. Why precocious puberty short stature while Gigantism peeps are tall?

- Precocious puberty --> Inc sex hormones --> promote both growth and **Epiphyseal plate closure** --> Initial growth spurt but later no growth
- Gigantism: GH hormone does not cause **Epiphyseal plate closure** --> grow taller via growth plate --> epiphyseal == cartilage!

### 20. Erythema Multiforme:

- Target inflammatory skin lesion
- Multiforme: Mycoplasma & HSV
- deposition of antigens in keratinocytes --> Inc cytotoxoci Tcell response

### 21. Skin lesion + 1 week history of focal neurologic deficit (seizure)

- Malignant melanoma metastasized to the brain
- also goes to GI, liver, lungs

### 22. Purulent cellulitis virulance factor?

- Panton Valentine Leukocidin from Staph Aureus

### 23. Non purulent cellulitis?

- Beta Hemolytic Streptococcia GROUP ABCD

### 24. Annular ring and scaling plaque five cm in diametr with central clearning?

- Tinea corporis
- ![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/36/b3/b8/36b3b85099c13dab635ae26599184106.jpg)


### 25. Axillary lymph ndoe dissection is a risk factor for?

- chronic lyphedema. Duhh!

### 26: LMN symptoms with signs of infection (headache, mailaise, fever):

- Poliovirus, anterior horn
- feco-oral --> oropharynx --> blood --> CNS --> Anterior horn!

### 26: Spinal Lesions

- Caudia equina syndrome:
    - Loss of knee and ankle reflex + bladder/anal control + saddle anesthesia
    - along with radicular pain ofcourse!


### 27: Port wine stain + kid + glaucoma + seizures?

- Sturge-Weber syndrome
- Somatic mosaicism - GNAQ
- Capillary vascular malform --> Port wine stain
- Leptomeningeal angioma --> seizures
- Episcleral hemagioma --> Inc ICT --> glaucoma (early oneset)

### 28: Natalizumab associated with JC Virus activaction leading to

- Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy
