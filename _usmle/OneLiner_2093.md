A patient’s physical symptoms are lacking an identifiable physical cause.  Sensation and deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) are intact, there’s no indication of stroke, is otherwise healthy. Sudden onset of motor dysfunction after a conflict (Eg: an argument with his wife) and normal neurologic exam and work-up suggests a somatoform disorder, most likely conversion disorder. Conversion disorder (also known as functional neurologic symptom disorder) mimics dysfunction in the voluntary motor or sensory system. Common presentations include pseudoseizures, vocal cord dysfunction, blindness, tunnel vision, deafness, and a variety of paresthesias and paralyses. Patients with conversion disorder experience involuntary loss of function, usually in response to a subconscious conflict. Labs/examination rule out pathologies.
