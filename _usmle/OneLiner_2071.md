Chronic skin blistering, tea-colored urine, & elevated transaminases most likely has porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), which is caused by inherited or acquired defects in the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase enzyme. Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase is involved in the heme biosynthetic pathway. In the setting of decreased uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity, uroporphyrins accumulate, causing tea-colored urine and blistering skin lesions on the sun-exposed areas (eg, forearms, hands).
