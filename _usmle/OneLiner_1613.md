Rabies is a single-stranded RNA virus of the Lyssavirus genus and is typically carried by bats, raccoons, and stray dogs. After inoculation, glycoproteins on the viral surface latch onto the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and facilitate entrance into motor and sensory neurons. The virus then travels via retrograde axonal transport, reaching the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord and eventually the brain. Histologic examination reveals Negri bodies, which are eosinophilic inclusion bodies seen in the cytoplasm of neurons of patients infected with rabies.
