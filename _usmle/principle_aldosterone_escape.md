Aldosterone escape refers to the fact that despite an increase in Aldosterone, Na and Water do not increase in the serum

Specifically:

↑Aldosterone ⇨ ↑Reabsorption of Na and Water from the collecting duct ⇨ ↑ExtraCellular Volume & ↑BP ⇨ ↑ANP release ⇨ ↑GFR, decreased Reabsorption of Na, -Renin,Aldostrone,ADH
