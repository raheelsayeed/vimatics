Deficiency of A1AT manifests itself by damaging the lungs.


Lung irritation:

- [alveolar-macrophages] -> Elastase -> Injury to alveolar walls

A1AT Defense: Inhibits elastase
- [Liver] -> a1at -> [alveolar sacs] -> [alveolar-macrophages] -> -elastase

Thus deficiency leads to Alveolar wall injury

    > Patients with a1-antitrypsin deficiency are also at risk for liver cirrhosis due to the accumulation of misfolded gene products of a1-antitrypsin in the hepatocellular endoplasmic reticulum

- origin: Liver
- manifestation-onset: <50 y
- bodysite: basilar lungs
- action: -elastase
- condition: Emphysema
- diagnosis: genetic-testing, serum a1at
