Congenital long QT syndrome commonly caused by mutation that slows the delayed rectifier potassium current that repolarizes the cardiomyocyte action potential. Medications (ABCDE) such as antiArrhythmics (Class IA and III), antiBiotics (macrolides), antiCychotics (haloperidol), antiDepressants (TCAs), antiEmetics (ondansetron) also slow the potassium repolarization current & prolong QT interval. Excessive QT prolongation can trigger serious cardiac cardiac arrhythmia (torsades De pointes) -> syncope & sudden cardiac death
