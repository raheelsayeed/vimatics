Early manifestations of Whipple disease usually include migratory arthralgia that affects the large joints. Because the disease is relatively rare compared with other disorders affecting the joints, up to 50% of affected individuals are misdiagnosed and treated for suspected seronegative inflammatory arthritis. Later in the disease course, these patients develop abdominal pain and diarrhea (watery or steatorrhea) as a result of malabsorption. This can eventually lead to wasting and weight loss.
