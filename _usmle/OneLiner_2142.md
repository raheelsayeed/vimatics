The arcuate fasciculus forms the neural connections between the Wernicke and Broca language areas in the dominant (usually left) hemisphere. A lesion here results in conduction aphasia, in which patients have intact comprehension and fluent (but paraphasic) speech (unlike in Wernicke and Broca aphasia), but are unable to repeat words or phrases.
