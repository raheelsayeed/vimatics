# Murmurs


### Paradoxical emboli --> ASD --> Wide, fixed splitting S2 (fixed=nochange in respiration)

- Pulmonic area --> mid-systolic ejection murmur --> resulting from increased blood flow across pulmonic valve
- Mid-diastolic rumble --> increased flow across tricuspid valve


### Ejection Systolic Murmer ---> HOCM / AS --> Increases in intensity on Standing? --> HOCM; Decreases in intensitity on Standing? --> AS 


### Valsalva Maneuver --> Decrease Venous return

- Bearing down, forceful exhalation

### Valsalva --> Loud Murmer in ?

- __Loud in HOCM__
- __Decreasing LVFilling --> Increase LV Outflow tract Obstruction (worsens) --> Murmer loud!__

### Valsalva --> Softer Murmur in ?

- __Soft in AS__ 
- __Decrease LV Filling__ --> __Decrease LVEDP__ --> less gradient, softer murmer

### HOCM Murmur

- Anything that reduces Preload --> Increase Murmur intensity
- Anything that increases Afterload --> Decrease Murmur intensity

### POST MI, continued High CK

- Reperfusion injury --> O2 radical damage to cell wall by neutrophils --> CK release from BRAIN/HEART/Muscle

### Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II or BMPR2 is a serine/threonine receptor kinase

- BMPR2 
- Connective tissue disease, HIV infection

### AR, MR, VSD murmurs increase when __\_\_load increases__?

- Afterload increases
- handgrip, squatting
