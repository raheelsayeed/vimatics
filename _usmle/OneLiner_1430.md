Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is caused by ineffective demargination - migration of neutrophils to infections. There are several mutations that can result in LAD, however they all share similar pathophysiology. Integrins are vital cell adhesion molecules which allow leukocytes to adhere to the wall of blood vessels and enter the tissues. If the building blocks of these molecules, such as CD18, are missing, then the leukocytes will not be able to migrate toward infections.These patients present with cold abscesses (abscesses that lack intense inflammation and are also described as a soft tissue mass) and staphylococcal infections. As macrophages are still functional in these patients, mycobacterial infections are not common.
