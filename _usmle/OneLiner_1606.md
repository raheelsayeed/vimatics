Interleukin-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine and is known to induce acute-phase protein synthesis. It is produced predominantly by T-cells (Th2), but also by macrophages. Acute-phase proteins are produced by the liver in response to inflammation. In addition to interleukin-6, other common positive acute-phase proteins that increase in plasma concentration are interleukin-1, interleukin-8, and TNF-Î±.
