Macrolides inhibit protein synthesis at the 50S subunit by blocking translocation and can be used to treat syphilis. However, macrolides are not considered first-line therapy. In patients with penicillin allergy, a macrolide (eg, erythromycin) can be used to treat primary syphilis and would not be contraindicated.
