Vasospastic angina involves intermittent coronary artery vasospasm leading to myocardial ischemia. This is due to hyperactivity of arterial smooth muscle due to a combination of endothelial dysfunction & autonomic imbalance. Findings: Reoccurring chest discomfort that spontaneously resolves within 15 mins. TX: Sublingual Nitroglycerin to relieve an active episode and CCB to prevent episodes.
