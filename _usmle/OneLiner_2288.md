All RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm except influenza and retroviruses. ssRNA virus can be positive strand (infectious) or negative strand (not infectious). Since negative strand ssRNA viruses are complementary to mRNA, they must first use viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase to synthesize positive sense RNA to be read by a ribosome for protein synthesis and initiate the infection. Without the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, negative sense RNA viruses are non-infectious.
