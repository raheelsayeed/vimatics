# Respiratory System

### Pulmonary Embolism -> Respiratory Alkalosis

- High V/Q ratio
- P.Emboli --> ischemia --> infl mediators, dyspnea --> stimulation of respiratory drive --> Hyperventilation --> __Hyperventilation__ --> CO2 removal (__Hypocapnea__) --> __Respiratory Alkalosis__
- CO2 removal is directly dependent on Ventilation
- O2 diffusion is limited by Hb Oxgcarrying capacity and it is maxed out already
