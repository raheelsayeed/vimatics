# Respiratory System

### Emphysema: Chronic Respiratory Acidosis w/ Metabolic Compensation

- Inc CO2 retension --> Inc Acidosis
- High HCO3 to compensate --> slightly acidic pH
- often with __Hypoxemia__ (PaO2 < 75 mmHg onroomair)

### Pulmonary Embolism -> Respiratory Alkalosis

- High V/Q ratio
- P.Emboli --> ischemia --> infl mediators, dyspnea --> stimulation of respiratory drive -->  __Hyperventilation__ --> CO2 removal (__Hypocapnea__) --> __Respiratory Alkalosis__
- CO2 removal is directly dependent on Ventilation
- O2 diffusion is limited by Hb Oxgcarrying capacity and it is maxed out already

### Hypercapnea and Hypoxemia in Obstructive Sleep Apnea 

- reflex Vasoconstriction --> Pulmonary hypertension


### Altitute Sickness

1. First: PiO2 is reduced (parttial pressure of inspiored oxygen) --> Hypoxemia --> Chemoreceptors trigger change and respond with __Hyperventilation__ --> Excessive C02 removal (Hypocapnea) --> __Respiratory Alkalosis__ 
2. Within ours to several days: Kidneys respond --> Decrease HCO3 reabsorption in PCT & Decrease H+ secretion --> Compensatory Metabolic Acidosis
3. Chronic Hypoxemia --> Inc EPO --> Inc RBC count
- Alkalosis causes LEFT SHIFT --> Reduced O2 delivery to tissues --> Eventually RBCs increase 2,3 BPG to increase O2 delivery`
