The underlying mechanism of DIC is activation of the coagulation cascade, which leads to microthrombi and global consumption of platelets, fibrin, and coagulation factors. Thrombus formation in the microvasculature results in microangiopathy with schistocytes and helmet-shaped cells. Complications include bleeding (eg, epistaxis in this patient), thrombosis, and organ failure. Laboratory findings include elevated prothrombin time, elevated partial thromboplastin time, elevated D-dimer level, and decreased platelet count.
