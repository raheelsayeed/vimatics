Becker muscular dystrophy. Becker muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a partially functioning dystrophin gene, resulting in muscular weakness and replacement of muscle with fatty tissue. The distribution of weakness can be similar to that of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, Duchenne muscular dystrophy presents in a younger age group, and its symptoms are more severe and progress much faster than those of Becker muscular dystrophy.
