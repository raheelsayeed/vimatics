Statins (eg, atorvastatin) work by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme required for the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. This consequently causes an upregulation of liver LDL receptors and a subsequent increase in LDL uptake. The result is a marked decrease in circulating LDL and total cholesterol concentrations. Side effects include hepatotoxicity (for which liver function must be monitored) and myopathy (particularly when combined with a fibrate or niacin).
