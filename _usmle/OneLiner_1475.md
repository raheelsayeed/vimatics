CN XII (hypoglossal nerve) mediates tongue movement, and LMN injury to one side the CN XII leads to ipsilateral tongue deviation because of the unopposed action of the opposite genioglossus muscle. So an injury to the left CN XII would result in deviation to the left, and injury to the right CN XII would result in deviation to the right. One way to remember this is by recalling the adage “The tongue licks its own wounds.”
