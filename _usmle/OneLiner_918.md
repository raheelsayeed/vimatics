A patient presents with age-related macular degeneration treated with periodic injections in the eye. Ranibizumab, pegaptanib sodium, and aflibercept, the three FDA-approved injected treatments for exudative (wet) age-related neovascular macular degeneration (AMD), work by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Ranibizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds to VEGF, pegaptanib sodium is a pegylated anti-VEGF aptamer, and aflibercept binds to circulating VEGF and acts as a “VEGF trap.” They function by inhibiting new blood vessel growth, known as angiogenesis.
