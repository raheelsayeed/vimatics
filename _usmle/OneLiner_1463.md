The murmur of aortic stenosis can best be auscultated over the right sternal border between the second and third ribs. It can be heard as a crescendo-decrescendo systolic ejection murmur with a soft S2 that is  loudest at the base of the heart and radiates to the carotids. Pulses are often weak with a delayed peak (“pulsus parvus et tardus”). Common clinical presentations of aortic stenosis include syncope, angina, and dyspnea on exertion.
