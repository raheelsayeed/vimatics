### Hyperglycemic state without SGLT inhibitor drug:

Hyperglycemic state --> Increase Glu in tubules --> Increased absorption @ PCT via SGLT cotransporter --> More of sodium is absorbed absorbed along with Glu --> Less Na in tubule at DCT --> Macula densa thinks "hey, waay less sodium excreted, release Renin!" --> RAAS Activated --> ACE constricts eferent arteriole --> Increased Glomerular Filteration (Hyperfiltration)

### SGLT-2 INHIBITION

SGLT-2 inhibitrs (-gliFs) in PCT --> Inc excretion of Na and Glu in urine --> Inc delivery of Na to macula densa --> No need of Renin! --> Less RAAS --> Less ACE --> Less constriction of eferentarteriole --> Reduction in Glomerular Filteration
