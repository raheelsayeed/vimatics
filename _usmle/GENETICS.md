# RNA Processing

1. IntraNuclear
    - 5' capping
    - poly-A tail addition
    - intron splicing
2. IntraCellular    
    1. Translation--> associate with Ribosomes
    2. Storage & Regulation --> associte with proteins found in __P-bodies__ 
    3. Poly-A tail is gradually shortened---> degradation
    

# Cell Division Phases

- G0: resting 
- Interphase - 
    1. G1 (RNA/Protein/lipid/carp synthesis)
    2. S (DNA synthesis)
    3. G2 (ATP syn) 
- M phase (Cell division) 

# Tumor Suppressor Gene: RB1 

- rb protein binds and inhibits E2F transcription factor --> prevent G1/S transition 
- When ready --> Rb protein phosphorylated by cyclin depdendent kinases --> E2F is uninhibited --> cell division
- __Loss of function --> retinoblastoma, osteosarcoma__
