# Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF) and also:

- Blindness: Leber (optic neuropathy)
- Stroke like episodes: Mito encephalopathy
- lactic acidosis


# Subtance P: Neuroopathic Pain; polypeptide neurotransmitter. Inhibited by Capsaicin Cream (topical) --> used in shingles

- Capsaicin --> blocks TRPV1 channel --> Intracellular Ca+ accumulation --> longlasting dysfunction of nocicpetive fibres --> Initial release and subsequent depletion of Substance P

# Developmental Delay & Progressive Skull enlargement --> Dandy Walker Formation

- Posterior fossa enlargement, block at luscka and magendi

# Arnold Chiari (II) associated with Spinal Myelomeningocele

# Preaqueductal gray matter & mamillary bodies hemorrhage and necrosis --> WERNIKE ENCEPHALOPATHHY


# THIAMINE Deficiency diagnosed by "erythrocyte transketolase activity" 

- increase in levels after addition of thaimine pyrophosphate

# Headache --> Subarachnoid hemorrhage --> (3-14 days) --> focal neurlogical (weakness in rt arm/leg) --> Cerebral Vasospasm;;; 

- CCB (nimodipine) --> Inc cerebral vasodilation, Dec cal-dependent toxicity


# Donapezil (AchEsterase Inhibitors) --> can cause bradycardia and AV block in the elderly.

# Orthostatic Htn --> Lisnorpil
