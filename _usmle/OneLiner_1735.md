Shigella dysentariae and Escherichia coli O157:H7-- both express shiga-toxin, with A and B components, these toxins can cause acute kidney injury, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, DIC, thrombocytopenia and fever. The B component binds to the cell membrane and allows entry of the A toxin. This component inactivates ribosomes, thereby stopping protein synthesis, which leads to cell death. They attach to intestinal epithelium, but only Shigella bacteria itself can invade the M cells in Peyer's patches of gastrointestinal mucosa and use the host cell filaments.
