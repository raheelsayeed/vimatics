Adverse effects of TCAs (Often used for refractory depression). TCA isn’t usually given for first line depression.  TCA side effects include sedation, α-receptor blocking effects, and most commonly, anticholinergic effects (ie, dry mouth, blurry vision, tachycardia, urinary retention, constipation, confusion, and dry, hot skin). These adverse effects can be remembered with the following mnemonics: Red as a beet (flushing), Dry as a bone (anhidrosis), Hot as a hare (overheating secondary to anhidrosis), Blind as a bat (blurry vision), Mad as a hatter (hallucinations or delirium), and Full as a flask (urinary retention).
