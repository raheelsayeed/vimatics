Patient presents with a severe pounding headache and vomiting. CT scan shows an intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH). Spontaneous (ie, nontraumatic) IPH occurs most commonly in middle to late adult life, and is most commonly caused by systemic hypertension. IPH may also be seen with amyloid angiopathy, recurrent lobar hemorrhagic strokes in the elderly, vasculitis, and neoplasms.
