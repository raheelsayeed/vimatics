Deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Patients with one or more elements of the Virchow triad (local trauma to the vessel wall, stasis, and hypercoagulability) are at increased risk for developing DVT. Thromboxane A2, produced by platelets, stimulates platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction and is elevated at the site of a forming clot. Thromboxane A2 also acts as an amplification signal for more potent platelet agonists, such as thrombin. Elevation of thromboxane A2 levels is a step in the signaling cascade that results in formation of a clot.
