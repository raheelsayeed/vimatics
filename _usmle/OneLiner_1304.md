Doxorubicin is another chemotherapeutic agent commonly used in the initial stage of ALL treatment. It inhibits DNA synthesis through the generation of free radicals that cause strand breaks. It also has the ability to intercalate (insert) between DNA base pairs, and therefore acts during multiple phases of the cell cycle but not during M phase.
