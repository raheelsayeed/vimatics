S/S: anorexia, malaise, chills, fatigue, night sweats, myalgias and arthralgias; present for months before diagnosis and can remain undiagnosed/chronic. Complications such as osteomyelitis or spondylodiscitis of the lumbar spine, sacroiliitis, and endocarditis which is the most common cause of death in infected patients.  Labs of infected patients rarely show leukocytosis. Patients are typically neutropenic and anemic, especially in chronic disease.
