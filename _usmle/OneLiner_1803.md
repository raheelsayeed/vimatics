Interferon-α is used for its leukocytic effects in patients with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Kaposi sarcoma, leukemias, and malignant melanoma. Interferon-α can activate some components of the immune response, such as increasing major histocompatibility complex expression and recruiting Th1 helper T cells, and therefore it has antitumor properties. Other treatments for Kaposi sarcoma include local radiation therapy and chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin or paclitaxel.
