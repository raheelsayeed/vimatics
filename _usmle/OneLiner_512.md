B. anthracis â€“ primarily in grass-grazing herbivores and spreads via droplets, cutaneous, and ingestion. 2 Main virulence factors: polypeptide capsule (composed of poly-y-D-glutamic acid -> inhibits phagocytosis) and trimeric exotoxin (protective antigen, edema factor, and lethal factor); Protective antigen binds to and opens a channel between macrophages, allowing edema factor and lethal factor to enter, lethal factor inhibits MAP kinase -> cell death, and edema factor increased cAMP -> accumulation of fluid and suppression of neutrophil/macrophage function.
