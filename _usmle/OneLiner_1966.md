Cholera toxin enters the cell and constitutively activates the Gs protein through ADP ribosylation. This results in a high level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which activates the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) channel, leading to a large efflux of chloride and other ions into the gastrointestinal lumen. The result is profuse watery diarrhea which can cause severe dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities.
