Constrictive Pericarditis â€“ elevated JVP with prominent x and y descent, pericardial knock (early diastolic sound that occurs before S3), pulsus paradoxus (>10 mm HG drop in systolic BP during inspiration), and Kussmaul sign (rigid pericardium prevents rt. side of the heart from accommodating increased venous return -> paradoxical rise in JVP during inspiration)
