An insulinoma is a benign tumor arising from the Î² cells of the pancreas; it causes increased insulin production, leading to repeated bouts of hypoglycemia, which subside with glucose intake.  Diagnosis is made on the basis of a decreased glucose level and increased C-peptide level. Treatment is excision of the tumor.
