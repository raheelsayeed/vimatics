A penetrating wound to the chest can puncture the pleura, creating an opening for air to be sucked into the pleural space. With inspiration, the diaphragm descends, lowering the intrapleural pressure. If there is communication directly between the pleural space and the outside world, air is sucked into this negative pressure space and collapses the lung. Pneumothorax is seen on x-ray of the chest as a collapsed lung.
