ALS, a neurodegenerative disease that affects both anterior horn cells (lower motor neurons) and corticospinal tract (upper motor neurons). Consequently, ALS results in a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs, although the deficits may be asymmetric. Lower motor neuron signs (fasiculations, weakness) are frequently the first noticed, with an eventual development of upper motor neuron signs (spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign). It typically affects adults over 40 years of age, with a higher incidence in men than women. Death: Respiratory Depression.
