CMV is part of a group of microbes that cause ToRCHeS infections, alongside Toxoplasma gondii, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, HIV, Herpes simplex virus-2, and Syphilis. Most ToRCHeS infections are transmitted from mother to fetus transplacentally; however, transmission during delivery (particularly with herpes simplex virus-2) is also possible in some cases. Any ToRCHeS infection can result in hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, thrombocytopenia (petechial skin rash), and growth retardation.
