Vincristine is a vinca alkaloid antineoplastic agent that binds to tubulin and inhibits microtubule formation. It is used to treat leukemias, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Wilms tumor, and choriocarcinoma. Vincristine is neurotoxic and causes sensorimotor neuropathy, leading to areflexia. Can also be used as part of multi-drug regime for MM.
