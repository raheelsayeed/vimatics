Treatment for children with ALL involves several phases, including induction, consolidation, maintenance, and CNS prophylaxis. Induction therapy is accomplished by a four-drug regimen that includes (1) a steroid (commonly prednisone or dexamethasone), (2) asparaginase, (3) doxorubicin/daunorubicin, and (4) vincristine.
