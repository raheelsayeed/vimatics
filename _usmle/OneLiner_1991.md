Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of osteomyelitis in the general population and should be assumed if no other information about the patient is given. Staphylococcus aureus is Gram-positive, catalase positive, and coagulase positive. Among patients who use illicit intravenous drugs, Pseudomonas aeruginosa should also be considered as a highly likely candidate, but it is still less common than S. aureus.
