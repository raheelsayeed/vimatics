Bupivacaine is a long-acting amide-based local anesthetic that blocks voltage-gated sodium channels and prevents depolarization. MOA of bupivacaine allows greater cardiotoxicity than other drugs in this class. It can produce arrhythmias and hypotension if administered IV. ECG after bupivacaine administration may show dropped beats with a constant PR interval. >>>has a second-degree heart block consistent with Mobitz type II. A Mobitz type II heart block is another cardiotoxic effect of bupivacaine when given intravenously.
