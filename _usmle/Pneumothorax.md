# Pneumothorax Pressure equalization --> Loss of negative intrapleural pressure

- Noramlly --> Patm == Palv and P(iPl) == -5.
- In pneumothorax --> Patm == Palv == P(ipL) --> Loss of negative intrapleural pressure

# Tension Pnumothorax --> Valve Effect --> P(ip) >> Patm 



# CYSTIC FIBROSIS --> PNEUMOTHORAX
