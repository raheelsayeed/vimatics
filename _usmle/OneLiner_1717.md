Treatment for ALL is divided into three phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance. Induction is designed to put the patient in remission and usually consists of treatment with vincristine, L-asparaginase, and prednisone. Prednisone acts as an agonist, passing through the plasma membrane and binding to the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor. The prednisone-glucocorticoid receptor complex then travels into the nucleus, where it binds to inverted DNA repeats, causing activation or suppression of specific genes and leading to apoptosis of immature lymphocytes. The prednisone-glucocorticoid receptor complex also leads to the production of anti-inflammatory proteins and suppresses cytokine synthesis. Prednisone also suppresses neutrophil migration and inhibits the production of cyclooxygenase-2.
