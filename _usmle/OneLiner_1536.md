Protamine sulfate is utilized in patients who overdosed on heparin with elevated PTTs (typically above 120s) and need rapid reversal. It can also be given to patients on heparin who need immediate surgery and therefore reversal of their PTT. Streptokinase, a thrombolytic agent used in cases of myocardial infarction, is contraindicated in anyone at risk of bleeding.
