Vitamin K is necessary for coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X. Because these coagulation factors are necessary for both the extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation cascade, a deficiency in vitamin K would lead to an increase in PT and aPPT. Notably, platelet count is unaffected as vitamin K deficiency only affects coagulation factors.
