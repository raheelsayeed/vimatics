LMWH and unfractionated heparin both have a pentasaccharide sequence that binds to antithrombin III, which can subsequently inactivate both factor Xa and thrombin. Due to its smaller molecular size, LMWH predominantly potentiates antithrombin to inhibit factor Xa. This is in contrast to unfractionated heparin, which has a larger molecular size and can potentiate antithrombin to inactivate both factor Xa and thrombin.
