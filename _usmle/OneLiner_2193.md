Pemphigus vulgaris, a acantholytic disorder of autoimmune origin that is distinct for its oral mucosal involvement and complete sparing of the basal cell layer. Acantholysis is the loss of cohesion between epidermal keratinocytes; in pemphigus vulgaris, acantholysis occurs due to the presence of IgG autoantibodies directed against desmosomes (macula adherens), which serve as the intercellular connections that bind cells together. The destruction of desmosomes by autoantibodies causes separation of epidermal cells, leading to ulcers of the mouth and skin. It is treated with prednisone.
