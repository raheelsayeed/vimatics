Caseating granulomas with central necrosis and Langhans giant cells are characteristic of secondary tuberculosis. In primary tuberculosis, imaging may reveal a Ghon complex, which involves hilar lymph nodes and a subpleural parenchymal lesion. In secondary tuberculosis, lesions are seen in the apical or posterior segments of the upper lobes. Another finding would be the presence of a cavitary lesion. None of these findings are observed on this patientâ€™s chest CT.
