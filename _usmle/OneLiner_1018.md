Initial treatment of AD involves acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which increase the amount of acetylcholine in the presynaptic space. Donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors often used for this purpose. Moderate-to-severe AD is an indication for memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. This drug blocks excitatory neurotoxicity, which is mediated by calcium influx, to prevent further neuronal damage.
