patient’s lightheadedness, dizziness, and fainting when rising from a sitting or lying position suggest that he is experiencing orthostatic hypotension. Orthostatic hypotensionis defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure 20 mm Hg from supine to standing. On standing, compensatory mechanisms normally increase vascular tone to maintain brain perfusion. Blacking out is the patient’s experience when these mechanisms fail.
