Parinaud syndrome, also known as the dorsal midbrain syndrome, is a supranuclear vertical gaze disturbance caused by compression of the tectal plate. It is characterized by an upward gaze palsy, often manifesting as diplopia. It has been classically associated with young patients with brain tumors in the pineal gland or midbrain. Pinealomas are the most common lesion producing this syndrome.
