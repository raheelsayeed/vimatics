Examples of first-generation (typical) antipsychotics include chlorpromazine, haloperidol, and fluphenazine. Examples of second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics include risperidone, aripiprazole, and clozapine. Hyperprolactinemia is treated with dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine and cabergoline. Bromocriptine is safe, but cabergoline may not be. These treatments can be used but should be approached with caution and frequent monitoring.
