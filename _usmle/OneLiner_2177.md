A patient presents with weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea, a palpable periumbilical node, and left supraclavicular adenopathy>> diagnosis of gastric cancer. S/S: abdominal pain, anorexia, early satiety, nausea, and/or dysphagia. Weight loss tends to be secondary to insufficient food intake, but may also be due to gastric stasis or outlet obstruction. Ab pain progressively worsens as disease spreads. Lymphatic spread is common. Exam findings may show a periumbilical nodule (called Sister Mary Joseph node) as well as left supraclavicular adenopathy (Virchow node). Patients may also develop anemia; local invasion into the duodenum, pancreas, and retroperitoneum is characteristic of gastric cancer.
