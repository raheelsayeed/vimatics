Bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa are commonly confused, as both can present with purging behavior (vomiting, excessive exercise, or some other type of compensatory behavior). Individuals who are obsessed with food and body weight and also practice restrictive eating are classified as having anorexia nervosa if their BMI <18.5 kg/m2 but are classified as having bulimia nervosa if their BMI >18.5 kg/m2.
