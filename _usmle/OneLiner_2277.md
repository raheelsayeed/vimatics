PCP develops when CD4<200 cells/mm3 and prophylactic treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is initiated. Initiate highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) when CD4<500 cells/mm3 (or earlier if the patient is motivated). HAART is a combination therapy made up of two NRTI + protease inhibitor/NNRTI (example: lamivudine + emtricitabine + ritonavir/efavirenz). The earlier treatment is started, the lower the risk of AIDS.
