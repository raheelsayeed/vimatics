In contrast, a noncommunicating hydrocephalus, also known as obstructive hydrocephalus, does not allow CSF to flow through the ventricular system, as in the case of aqueductal stenosis. Noncommunicating hydrocephalus causes an increase in CSF pressure in the ventricles. This patient has normal CSF pressure, ruling out a noncommunicating pathology. They would have a headache etc.
