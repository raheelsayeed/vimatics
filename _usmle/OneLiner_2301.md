Fibroadenomas are the most common benign breast tumors and usually occur in women who are 20 to 35 years of age. The tumors present as small, firm, mobile masses. On histologic examination, fibrotic interlobular stroma is seen around normal duct and gland structures. Fibroadenomas are frequently single, well-circumscribed, rubbery, and painless masses. They are responsive to hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle and often become hyalinized and can calcify, mimicking carcinomas of the breast on mammography. Diagnosis of a stable fibroadenoma in a young woman is usually followed by ultrasonography; however, a biopsy is indicated if there is any doubt about malignancy or if the mass is growing.
