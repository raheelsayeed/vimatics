Chronic bacterial infections and oculocutaneous albinism are signs of Ch√©diak-Higashi syndrome, which is caused by an autosomal-recessive defect in the lysosomal-trafficking regulator gene, resulting in failure of microtubule-mediated lysosomal transport and fusion of vesicles to the cell membrane. Stalled lysosomal vesicles can be observed histologically as darkened granules within cell cytoplasm.
