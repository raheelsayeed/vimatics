Pyruvate carboxylase is an enzyme in the gluconeogenesis pathway, which converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate, a reaction that is essentially irreversible. The enzyme is activated by acetyl-CoA, and the cofactors are ATP and biotin. Biotin deficiency is relatively rare and is usually caused by total parenteral nutrition without biotin supplementation, antibiotic use, or excessive ingestion of raw egg whites.
