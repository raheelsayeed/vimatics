Wilms tumor arises from neoplastic embryonic renal cells of the metanephros, there is an abnormal proliferation of the metanephric blastema usually referred as nephrogenic rests. Nephrogenic rests may usually regress in childhood, however, if they do not regress, they may transform in Wilms tumor. There are many mutations associated with Wilms tumor such as WT1, FWT1m FWT2 and p53. In the case of WT1 mutation, Wilms tumor can also be associated with WAGR syndrome and Denys-Drash syndrome. It is associated with the deletion of tumor suppressor gene WT1 on chromosome 11
