Krukenberg tumors are malignancies in the ovaries that are metastases from a primary tumor, usually located in the gastrointestinal tract. Patients present with abdominal pain as well as bloating and ascites. Occasionally, patients may also have hirsutism. Histologically, the overproduction of mucin pushes the nucleus to the side of the cell, producing the characteristic "signet ring" morphology of gastric cancer and Krukenberg tumor.
