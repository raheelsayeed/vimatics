Delayed hydrolysis of sugars and absorption of glucose is the mechanism of action of α-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose. Sulfonylureas, such as glyburide, tolbutamide, and glipizide, work by closing potassium channels in the β-cell membrane, resulting in depolarization and calcium influx, thereby triggering the release of insulin.
