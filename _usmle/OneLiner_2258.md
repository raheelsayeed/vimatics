The linear pattern present in the patientâ€™s kidney biopsy specimen is diagnostic of Goodpasture syndrome, an autoimmune disease. Goodpasture syndrome is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). This type of autoimmune reaction constitutes a type II cytotoxic hypersensitivity reaction in which  antibodies attack a specific tissue. A linear appearance of the antibodies attached to the GBM, viewed with immunofluorescent microscopy, indicates a diagnosis of Goodpasture syndrome. Renal involvement in Goodpasture syndrome leads to hematuria, anemia, and crescentic glomerulonephritis. This syndrome can involve both the pulmonary and renal systems and can thus present with hemoptysis and hematuria.
