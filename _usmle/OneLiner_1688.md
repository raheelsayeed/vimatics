Acetaminophen OD - treatment may be initiated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which is a precursor for the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione. Excess glutathione normally forms conjugates with the toxic metabolite of acetaminophen, NAPQI, which accumulates and causes liver damage after glutathione depletion. Replenishing glutathione with NAC will improve elimination of NAPQI and prevent further liver injury.
