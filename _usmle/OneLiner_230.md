Hepatic infarcts are rare due to dual blood supply; hepatic artery becomes occluded -> portal vein supplies retrograde via accessory vessels (inferior phrenic, adrenal, intercostal arteries, etc). Exception in transplanted liver which undergoes hepatic artery thrombosis (collateral bl. Supply severed)
