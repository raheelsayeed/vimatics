Complete AV canal defect, most common cardia defect in Down syndrome (autosomal trisomy). Failure of endocardial cushion fusion results in an ostium primum septal defect; a ventral septal defect; & a single AV valve. Significant left-to-right shunting & AV valve regurgitation lead to excessive pulmonary blood flow & symptoms of heart failure (e.g. Tachypnea, poor feeding). Auscultatory findings of AV valve regurgitation (holosystolic, best heard at the apex) & increased PVR (mid-diastolic rumble) are characteristic.
