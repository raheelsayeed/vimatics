Ranitidine belongs to the class of drugs termed H2-receptor antagonists. Other H2-receptor antagonists include famotidine and cimetidine. They bind to H2-receptors on parietal cells to block the receptors' interaction with histamine. H2-receptors are coupled via a Gs regulatory protein to adenylate cyclase and stimulate cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) formation, meaning that H2-receptors are Gs-coupled receptors. Therefore blockage of H2-receptors means that Gs-coupled receptors have been inhibited
