The HIV genome contains 3 major structural genes that are translated as polyproteins & subsequently cleaved by host protease (env gene products) or viral protease (gag-pol gene products) into the individual proteins that compose the HIV virus. Protease inhibitors block viral protease from cleaving gag-pol polyproteins, which results in the formation of immature virions that are noninfectious.
