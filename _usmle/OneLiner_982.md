Bronchiectasis appears as a dilated bronchial tissue with necrotizing inflammation.Common causes of bronchiectasis include lung infections (eg, severe pneumonia, whooping cough, tuberculosis), fungal infections of the lung (eg, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis), and conditions that first damage the airways and then leave patients susceptible to infection (eg, cystic fibrosis and ciliary disorders such as Kartagener syndrome, chronic aspiration, and connective tissue diseases).
