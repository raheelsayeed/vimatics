Goodpasture syndrome causes a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Although immunofluorescence will demonstrate classic linear deposition of IgG, light microscopy reveals crescentic glomerulonephritis (cellular crescent formation and fibrosis). These light microscopic findings are also seen in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Itâ€™s important to note that Goodpasture syndrome is a nephritic, not a nephrotic, disorder.
