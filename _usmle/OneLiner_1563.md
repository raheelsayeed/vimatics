Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant and is often used in transplant recipients to control graft-versus-host disease that may result from allogeneic bone transplant. The drug inhibits transcription of interleukin-2 and other cytokines important for T-lymphocyte activation, thus dampening the cell-mediated immune response. However, cyclosporine has potential renal toxicity.
