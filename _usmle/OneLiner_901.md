If a patient who has had an ischemic stroke presents within 3 hours and has no contraindications, the standard treatment is tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Tissue plasminogen activator is secreted by endothelial cells and is the enzyme most directly responsible for degrading the fibrin matrix. Recombinant tPA (alteplase) and streptokinase are similar medications that are used to treat diseases in which fibrin clots prevent adequate blood flow to tissue, such as stroke, pulmonary embolus, and myocardial infarction.
