Beta 1 agonists such as dobutamine and isoproterenol stimulate beta 1 receptors, which are Gs proteins that increase adenylyl cyclase. This increases cAMP, then cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which phosphorylates phospholamban that disinhibits SERCA in the cardiomyocytes causing increased heart rate and contractility.
