Gemfibrozil is a fibrate used for lipid-lowering that is particularly helpful in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. It activates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, which increases triglyceride clearance. Fibrates are associated with cholesterol gallstones, by reducing cholesterol solubility and reducing bile acid synthesis secondary to inhibition of 7-α-hydroxylase (the key enzyme in bile acid synthesis). Thus, gemfibrozil and other fibrate medications may be responsible for—or contribute to—gallstone formation.
