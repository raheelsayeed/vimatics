### Phentermine, Diethylpropion, benzphetamine

- Sympathomimetics (NE)
- weightloss drugs (short therapy)
- CI in CVD patients
- Increased sensation of satiety, reduced calorie intake

### Regular Insulin & NPH --> only human recomb insulin without any modifications to AA sequence

### DKA treated with Regular Insulin!

### Insulin Supresses Glucagon secretion by directly acting on pancreatic alpha cells!

### Long standing T1-DM have alpha cell failure due to repeated inhibition by Insulin 

- Results in Frequent Hypolgycemic events -->  

### T3 = short half life, mostly produced peripherally and can be normal in Primary Hypothyroidism

### Infant, inc muscle tone, caramel/sugar smell urine, Autosomal recessive (hx of someone who died at a young age) 

- branched chain alpha keto acid dehydrogenase requires TLCFN
- Rx: Thiamine


### FGFReceptor-1 or KAL-1 gene defect --> failure of migration of GnRH secreting neurons from Olfactory placade (anosmia) --to--> Hypothalamus 


### Hypercholesterolemia, Familial Dyslipedmias: Key signs

1. Type1: plasma LPL defect --> incrased Chylomicron, TG --> __Acute Pancreatitis__, milky appearing retinal vasculature (lipemia retinalis), eruptive xanthomas (small yellowish papules) 
    - creamy layer in supernatent
1. Type2: LDL Receptor defect --> Inc LDL (plasma) --> __Tendon Xanthomas__, __Xanthelasmas(medial eyelids)__, __Premature CAD__
3. Type3: ApoE defect -->  Inc VLDL, Chylomicrons --> __Tuboeruptive Palmar Xanthomas__
4. Type4: ApoA-V defect --> Inc TG(>1000), VLDL --> Insulin sensitivity decreased --> DM

- Xanthelasmas: dermal accumulations of macrophages containing cholesterol, TG
