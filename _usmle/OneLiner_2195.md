Hemidesmosomes are present in the basal cell plasma membrane and serve to anchor the epidermal basal cells to the underlying extracellular matrix. When autoantibodies directed against hemidesmosomes are present, the disease is called bullous pemphigoid. This can be distinguished from pemphigus vulgaris in that it is less severe and the oral mucosa is not involved. The basal cell layers are primarily affected, resulting in subepidermal rather than intraepidermal bullae.
