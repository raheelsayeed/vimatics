The current first-line combination chemotherapy regimen for Hodgkin lymphoma in the US is the ABVD regimen: Adriamycin (doxorubicin), Bleomycin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine. The original combination chemotherapy regimen for Hodgkin lymphoma is known as the MOPP regimen: Mechlorethamine, Oncovin (vincristine), Procarbazine, and Prednisone. This regimen proved capable of curing more than 70% of patients and is still used for patients who relapse or have allergies that prevent them from taking the ABVD regimen. Prednisone is a prodrug of prednisolone. Prednisone is an inactive compound that must be reduced to its active form, prednisolone, which has anti-inflammatory effects. The enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is 11-Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.
