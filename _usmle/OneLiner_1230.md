An alternative to chlorpromazine is clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia. It is less likely to cause the tardive dyskinesia associated with typical antipsychotics, such as chlorpromazine, since it does not block dopamine 2 (D2) receptors as strongly. Further support that the patient was switched to clozapine is his low WBC count; drug-induced agranulocytosis is a known side effect of clozapine and requires regular blood testing. Other side effects of clozapine include mouth and throat ulcers, myocarditis, weight gain, and sialorrhea. Because of its side effects and the need to test the patientâ€™s blood regularly, clozapine is considered a medication of last resort in refractory or severe cases of schizophrenia.
