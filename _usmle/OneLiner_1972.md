Non-coding, repetitive nucleotide sequences (eg, TTAGGG) found on the ends of chromosomes most closely describes telomeres. These regions serve to protect the important coding regions of chromosomes from damage or loss of genetic material. By utilizing a RNA-dependent telomerase, telomeres can extend the length of the chromosome by adding non-coding regions via a reverse transcriptase. Although some genetic material will still be lost during DNA replication, it will only be from the newly added, non-coding telomeres. Thus, the chromosomes can be replicated indefinitely and maintain chromosomal integrity without shortening.
