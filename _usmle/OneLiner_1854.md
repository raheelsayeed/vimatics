PTH functions to increase serum calcium by stimulating 1-Î±-hydroxylase enzyme to form more calcitriol, increasing bone resorption of calcium by binding to PTH receptors on osteoblasts, and also directly increasing renal reabsorption of calcium in the DCT. PTH binding to osteoblasts results in increased IL-1 production and decreased osteoprotegerin, and these changes drive osteoclast activation.
