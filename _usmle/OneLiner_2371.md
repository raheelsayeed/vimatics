MOA:TCAs inhibit the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE). Adverse effects include sedation, postural hypotension, and anticholinergic side effects like tachycardia, urinary retention, and dry mouth. TCAs can also prolong the QT interval. The antihistamine adverse effects of TCAs include sedation, weight gain, and confusion (especially seen in the elderly).
