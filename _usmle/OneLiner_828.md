Liddle syndrome is commonly treated with a diuretic that inhibits ENaC (epithelial sodium channel in the collecting tubules of the kidney), such as triamterene or amiloride. Spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, would improve a patientâ€™s hypokalemia, but would not address the constitutive activation of ENaC that occurs with Liddle syndrome.
