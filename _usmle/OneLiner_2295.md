Phenoxybenzamine, an irreversible, nonselective α-blocker, is the drug of choice for α-blockade in pheochromocytoma. However, blocking α-receptors can lead to hypotension, as vasoconstriction is impaired. Other adverse effects of this drug include gastrointestinal upset, headache, and inhibition of erection.
