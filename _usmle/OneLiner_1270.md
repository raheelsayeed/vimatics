Insulin binds to the insulin receptor that has tyrosine kinase activity. The most important adverse effects of insulin are hypoglycemia and injection site reactions. Sodium-dependent glucose transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors such as canagliflozin are not safe to prescribe for patients with renal disease. SGLT-2 inhibitors block the reabsorption of glucose in the kidney. Major adverse effects include urinary tract infections, kidney injury, and hypotension.
