Fibrates (eg, gemfibrozil) upregulate lipoprotein lipase and have profound triglyceride-lowering properties. They also activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-Î±) to induce HDL synthesis. In patients with very high triglyceride concentrations, fibrates are used to prevent the development of pancreatitis. They are not first line for preventing adverse cardiovascular outcomes in peripheral vascular disease or cardiovascular disease.
