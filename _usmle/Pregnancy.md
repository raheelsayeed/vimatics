Pregnancy
=========



# Increased Peripheral vasodilators --> NO, Prostacycline --> Reduced SVR --> Mild hypotension --> Activation of RAAS --> Incraeased Water and Na reabsorption --> Fluid retension --> Increased VENOUS RETURN --> INCREASED CARDIAC PRELOAD --> INCREASED CARDIAC OUTPUT!


- INC CO, VR, CARDIAC PRELOAD, stroke volume
- DEC SVR
- NORMAL: Central Venous Pressure

## mild hypoproteinemia (because of increased water/na) --> edema fluid retension
