The image provided with the question shows schistocytes, a common finding in a peripheral blood smear of a patient with TTP. Elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase and indirect bilirubin are common laboratory findings. The classic pentad of TTP consists of fever, thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurologic symptoms, and acute kidney injury (a fall in GFR). An elevated creatinine concentration would be expected in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI), as occurs in TTP.
