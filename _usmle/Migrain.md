# Migrain


- increase cerebral excitability --> diffuse cortical transmission --> coupled with CGRP activation and release --> neuropain transmission --> trigeminal spread (unilateral) and to the meningies

- calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP


- auro --> visual (scotomas) or sensory (uliteral extremity parasthesia) 


The role of CGRP in migraine pathogenesis has been supported by the effectiveness of triptans ([5-HT1B/1D] receptor agonists that decrease CGRP release) and anti-CGRP antibodies (eg, erenumab) in treating migraine headaches.
