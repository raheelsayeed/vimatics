Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is an autoimmune cause of hypercoagulability thought to be precipitated by the inappropriate activation of coagulation factors. It is commonly characterized by recurrent venous thrombosis or frequent fetal loss, and it is confirmed by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and a prolonged partial thromboplastin time. However, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is acquired and would not be consistent with a family history of thrombotic events.
