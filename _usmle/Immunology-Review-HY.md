### Interferons secretd upon Virus infection

- Inf Alpha, Beta synthesized in response to virus infection --> Secreted out and bind to Inf receptors in neihhbouring cells --> paracrine/autocrine signalling --> Transcription of antiviral enzymes __RNase L (endonuclease that degrades RNA in the cell)__ and __ProteinKinaseR__ --> PKR ---(-)-> __elF-2__ --> Active only in double stranded RNA --> Thus only infects cells with viral replication and does not hinder uninfected cells

- Induce MHC I --> T, NK cell activity increase
