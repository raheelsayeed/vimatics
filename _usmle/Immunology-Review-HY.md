### Interferons secretd upon Virus infection

- Inf Alpha, Beta synthesized in response to virus infection --> Secreted out and bind to Inf receptors in neihhbouring cells --> paracrine/autocrine signalling --> Transcription of antiviral enzymes __RNase L (endonuclease that degrades RNA in the cell)__ and __ProteinKinaseR__ --> PKR ---(-)-> __elF-2__ --> Active only in double stranded RNA --> Thus only infects cells with viral replication and does not hinder uninfected cells

- Induce MHC I --> T, NK cell activity increase


### Cladribine, Coformycin: ADA inhibtors

- Hairy cell leukemia 


### Chronic Lung Transplant Rejection

- Submucosal lymphocytic inflammation in the walls of small airways
- ingrowth of granulation tissue --> airway __obliterans__ --> slowly worsening dyspnea and dry cough --> months to years

### Hyperacute lung rejection

- hemorrhagic/ischemia --> fibrinoic necrosis --> antibodies to donor HLA/ABO groups of donor

### ACute lung rejection

- Ab to donor HLA. Cell mediated immune response
- perivascular mononuclear infiltrates --> expand into alveolar walls 

### Acute vs Chronic 

- acute: pervascular mononuc infiterates
- chronic: submucosal lymphocytic inflammation
