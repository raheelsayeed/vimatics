- Clozapine --> transiently, loosely binds to D2 dopamine receptors --> may cause seizures, myocarditis

- Increase Baro Firing -- Inc Parasympathetic Firing
- Decrease Baro firing --> Decrease Parasymp Firing


- HumanDrugResistance gene--> MDR1 --> P-Glycoprotein --> ATP Dep transmembrane protein --> CNS barrier/intestinal/renal tubular epithemlium --> removes foreight chemicals. CANCER: removes drug: anthracyclines


- GVHD: invovles SKIN, GI
 - Diffuse maculopapular rash
 - Hepatosplenomegaly


- CHRONIC Alcholics = Vitamin def: also B2 (riboflavin!)
 - Delirium: hallucinations
 - Delirium Tremends: hallucinations + restlessness + elevated Vital Signs!!!!!!!!!
 

 - LAC OPERON
    - Z: beta galactosidase --> Lactose to Glu and Gal
    - Y: permease (Inc permeability of cell to lactose)
    - a: transacetylator

- Sick Sinus Syndrome --> Age related degeneration of Sinoatrial node --> Junctional Skipped beat, delayed or absent P wave


- bundle branch block --> Wide QRS Complex
- Narrow QRS --> Escaped Junctional beat


- Ectopic ACTH --> Sever Hypercortisol --> activation of mineralocorticoids --> Aldosterone
 - For example: in Cancers -- ectopic acth production (lungs)

- Serine Protease --> PCSK9 ---> inhibited by evolumab

- Where are catalase, uric acid oxidase, d-aminoacid oxidase produced?
 - Peroxisomes, high in liver and kidney --> detoxifies!


- snRNP: a non coding RNA, transcribed by RNA Polymerase II which then associates with specific proteins.
 - __Splicesosome__: Collection of snRNPs


 - Associations of Polycythemia Vera
  - Gouty arhtirtis (cell turn over!)
  - peptic ulcer disease (viscus blood -- !flow)
