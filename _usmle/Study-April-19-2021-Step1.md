- Prednisone/steroids promote osteoclastic activity AND inhibit osteoblastic activity --> promote bone resorption

- Esophagus --> Ring like indentations, linear furrowing scattered whitish papules (e. microabscess) --> Eosinophilic Esophagitis 

- Enlarged __BUT Nontender Gallbladder__ --> Pancreatic adenocarcinoma --> __Painless Obsstructive Jaundice__

- CD31 -- PECAM1 --> Transmigration
- CD54 -- ICAM --> Adhesion

- Aspirin --> mitochondrial injury --> impaired fatty acid metabolism --> microvesicular steatosis --> small fat vacuoles in the cytoplasm __without__ necrosis --> REYE SYNDROME


- Chelating agents
    - Phosphate binder: __Calcium acetate__ --> exchanges calcium for phosphate -- use din endstage kidney
    - sodium polystryene rasin: exchange intraluminal sodium with __potassium__ --> used for Hyperkalemia
   
- Rifaximin: also used for travellers diarrhea --> inhibits bacterial RNA synthesis by binding to DNA-dep-RNA polymerase

- SECRETIN --> when there is acid and fat in the small intestine --> secretin released from Duodenum --> (-) Gastrin release, (+) HCO3 release
    - __IN GASTRINOMA__: opposite --> secretin --(+)> Gastrin release

- HepA: frequent travellers, young adults --> hepatocyte necrosis(swelling) & apoptosis(shrinkage)

- Clozapine --> transiently, loosely binds to D2 dopamine receptors --> may cause seizures, myocarditis

- Baroreceptors
    - Increase Baro Firing -- Inc Parasympathetic Firing
    - Decrease Baro firing --> Decrease Parasymp Firing


- HumanDrugResistance gene--> MDR1 --> P-Glycoprotein --> ATP Dep transmembrane protein --> CNS barrier/intestinal/renal tubular epithemlium --> removes foreight chemicals. CANCER: removes drug: anthracyclines


- GVHD: invovles SKIN, GI
    - Diffuse maculopapular rash
    - Hepatosplenomegaly


- CHRONIC Alcholics = Vitamin def: also B2 (riboflavin!)
    - Delirium: hallucinations
    - Delirium Tremends: hallucinations + restlessness + elevated Vital Signs!!!!!!!!!
 

 - LAC OPERON
    - Z: beta galactosidase --> Lactose to Glu and Gal
    - Y: permease (Inc permeability of cell to lactose)
    - a: transacetylator

- Sick Sinus Syndrome --> Age related degeneration of Sinoatrial node --> Junctional Skipped beat, delayed or absent P wave



- bundle branch block --> Wide QRS Complex
- Narrow QRS --> Escaped Junctional beat


- Ectopic ACTH --> Sever Hypercortisol --> activation of mineralocorticoids --> Aldosterone
 - For example: in Cancers -- ectopic acth production (lungs)

- Serine Protease --> PCSK9 ---> inhibited by evolumab

- Where are catalase, uric acid oxidase, d-aminoacid oxidase produced?
 - Peroxisomes, high in liver and kidney --> detoxifies!


- snRNP: a non coding RNA, transcribed by RNA Polymerase II which then associates with specific proteins.
 - __Splicesosome__: Collection of snRNPs


 - Associations of Polycythemia Vera
  - Gouty arhtirtis (cell turn over!)
  - peptic ulcer disease (viscus blood -- !flow)
