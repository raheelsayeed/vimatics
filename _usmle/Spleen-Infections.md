# What the hell does spleen actually do to protect from bacteria!???


- Splenic cords --> lined by macrophages --> bacteria gets trapped and ingested --> macs present captured antigens to B/T cells residing in splening white pulp --> B cells produce antibodies (splenic) that constitute Half of the total antibodies --> Abs opsonize bacteria, particularly the encapsulated ones as they escape innate phagocytosis.
- Vaccines against S. pnemonie, H.influenza, N.menin
