In a chronic condition (like SLE), the liver will secrete Hepcidin, an inflammatory mediator that sequesters (saves) Iron that would other be consumed by, perhaps the invading pathogens. 

Hepcidin inhibitis ferroportin -> (-)exit of Iron from iron-exporting-cells ( RBCs,macs,hepaticytes) --> Iron sequestered into the Liver --> Low Serum Iron --> Anemia --> Normocytic
