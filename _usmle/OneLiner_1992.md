Busulfan is a cell cycle-independent cancer drug that works by alkylating DNA to form cross-links between DNA strands. When the intrastrand DNA cannot be repaired by the cell, the cell undergoes apoptosis. Busulfan is not the correct answer because the patient is not being treated with a cell cycle-nonspecific medication.
