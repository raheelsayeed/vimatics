Factor V Leiden is the most common inherited cause of hypercoagulability, a pathologic state that predisposes the affected individual to thrombus formation. It is more common in the Caucasian population than other ethnicities. Normally, activated protein C cleaves factor V, terminating the clotting cascade. In people with factor V Leiden, factor Va is resistant to this cleavage, preventing protein C from degrading factor  ->  5-fold increase risk of DVT or PE in heterozygosity; homozygosity confers a 90-fold increased risk.
