Orthostatic hypotension in the clinical setting is commonly caused by different classes of medications which can alter preload or vasoconstriction. Common medications that can cause orthostatic hypotension include alpha-1 blockers (inhibit vasoconstriction via alpha-1 block), tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, imipramine which have alpha-1 blocking activity, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO), alcohol, and marijuana. Calcium channel blockers, such as amlodipine, can cause dizziness due to vascular smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation.
