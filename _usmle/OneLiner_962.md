S. aureus and Escherichia coli produce alpha hemolysin, a toxin that destroys cell membranes of RBCs and WBCs (and leads to the characteristic clearing surrounding these bacteria on blood agar). E. coli can cause septic arthritis, but unlike H. influenzae, it is a gram-negative bacillus (not coccobacillus) and can grow on blood agar.
