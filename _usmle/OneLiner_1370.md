systemic mycoses, specifically Blastomycosis, which occurs after inhalation of the dimorphic fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis. The pathogen is endemic to the Midwest regions of the United States, including the Great Lakes. Biopsy specimen of affected areas shows the characteristic yeast, which is thick walled and spherical, producing single buds with a broad base of attachment. Blastomycosis often presents with flu-like symptoms, fevers, chills, cough, and pleuritic chest pain. Moderate pulmonary disease and mild disseminated disease, as seen in this patient, may be treated with oral itraconazole. Severe pulmonary disease, moderate disseminated disease, and disease in immunocompromised patients may be treated with intravenous amphotericin B.
