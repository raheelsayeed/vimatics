A patient presents with weight loss, signs of anemia, generalized lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly, which strongly suggests a non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Systemic symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma may include “B” symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and drenching night sweats. These symptoms—which can be seen in both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma—are observed in approximately 40% of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and are a poor prognostic indicator. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma often involves multiple lymph nodes, while extranodal involvement is also common. One risk factor for non-Hodgkin lymphoma is immunosuppression.
