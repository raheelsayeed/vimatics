Leuprolide is a gonadotropin-release hormone (GnRH) agonist that binds GnRH receptors in the pituitary in a constant fashion, as opposed to the physiologic pulsatile release of GnRH. Constant activation of GnRH receptors by leuprolide desensitizes the receptors and inhibits the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). As a result, downstream androgen synthesis is reduced, causing regression of the tumor.
