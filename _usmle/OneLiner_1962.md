Atenolol is a B1-selective blocker that dose-dependently inhibits myocardium B1 receptors. B1 agonists would have difficulty outcompeting such a drug. As a result, glucagon would serve as an effective treatment by activating adenylate cyclase and thereby increasing cAMP levels by targeting a Gs receptor. This would raise the patient’s heart rate and increase contractility. α1-agonists such as epinephrine may help increase TPR and raise blood pressure; however, they would not increase contractility of the heart.
