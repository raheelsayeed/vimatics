Pancreatic islet cells can give rise to insulinomas or glucagonomas that can manifest with hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, respectively. There is no mention of any sugar abnormalities in this patient. Furthermore, it is extremely rare for a pancreatic islet cell tumor to have obstructive jaundice as its presenting symptom. This is because they start to produce symptoms while they are much smaller in size and generally do not grow as large as a pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
