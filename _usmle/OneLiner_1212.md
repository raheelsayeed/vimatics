Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), which can be effective for the treatment of atypical depression and anxiety. However, MAOIs are not first-line treatments for social anxiety disorder due to extensive side effects and the possibility of severe adverse outcomes, such as hypertensive crisis. MAOIs are contraindicated in patients taking serotonin-modulating antidepressants and some over-the-counter cold medications (eg, dextromethorphan), which when taken concurrently with MAOIs, may result in serotonin syndrome.
