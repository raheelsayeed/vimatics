VIPoma, a pancreatic tumor that secretes vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) -> profuse watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, an elevated gastric pH (achlorhydria), as well as CT findings consistent with a pancreatic mass. This hormone is normally secreted from parasympathetic ganglia throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The functions of VIP include increased secretion of water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen and relaxation of intestinal smooth muscle and sphincters.  His severe diarrhea leads to the loss of potassium (hyperkalemia) and bicarbonate (normal anion gap metabolic acidosis), suggested by his low serum bicarbonate.
