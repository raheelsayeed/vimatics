Cryptogenic stroke – patent foramen ovale (PTO) and atrial septal defect (ASD); incomplete fusion in 25% of healthy adults of septum primum and septum secundum, with increased right atrial pressure relative to left atrium can cause shunting of blood, and “air bubbles” to pass through in diagnostic echocardiogram with agitated normal saline injection. Hypercoagubility (OCPs) can cause paradoxical brain embolism.
