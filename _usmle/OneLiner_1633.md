Pilocytic astrocytomas are a low-grade astrocytoma typically found in the posterior fossa of children and are uncommon in adults. Pathology would show bipolar neoplastic cells with elongated hair like processes that are arranged in parallel bundles and resemble mats of hair. Pilocytic astrocytomas often have Rosenthal fibers, which are swollen pink axons.
