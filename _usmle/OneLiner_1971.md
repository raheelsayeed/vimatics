Management of acromegaly involves treatment with octreotide, a synthetic octapeptide analog of somatostatin, which is more potent than the natural form. Somatostatin is secreted by the hypothalamus and acts at the anterior pituitary to suppress and regulate basal GH secretion. However, somatostatin is also secreted by the D cells in the pancreatic islets and gastrointestinal mucosa to help decrease gastric acid and pancreatic enzyme secretion. In addition to acromegaly, octreotide is used in the treatment of secretory pancreatic tumors (gastrinomas, glucagonomas, VIPomas) and carcinoid tumors.
