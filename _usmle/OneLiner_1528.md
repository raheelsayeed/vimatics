The Vibrio cholerae toxin ADP ribosylates the Gs-α subunit. This Gs-α subunit activates adenylyl cyclase but cannot hydrolyze the bound GTP to GDP. Therefore the Gs-α subunit continuously activates adenylyl cyclase, which increases cAMP levels and overactivates protein kinase A. Pprtein kinase A phosphorylates the CFTR chloride channel, increasing chlorine excretion and causing the subsequent H2O efflux and characteristic "rice-water" diarrhea.
