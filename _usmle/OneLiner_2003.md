Hypertensive retinopathy is the result of chronic hypertension. The result is arteriovenous nicking (crossing abnormalities), arteriosclerosis (copper wire), and hyperplasia of vessel walls (silver wire). Other symptoms are from ischemia (cotton-wool spots), and can have areas of hemorrhage and hard exudates.
