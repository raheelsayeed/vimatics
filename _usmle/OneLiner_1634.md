Mental status, discolored urine/myoglobinuria, muscle rigidity, and fever subsequent to the addition of haloperidol -> neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which can be a serious adverse effect of antipsychotic (neuroleptic) agents due to a decrease in dopamine signaling induced by haloperidol. Rx: discontinue all neuroleptics, dantrolene and bromocriptine. Dantroline is a skeletal muscle relaxant that works by inhibiting calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle. Bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist commonly used to treat Parkinson disease, can also reverse this process.
