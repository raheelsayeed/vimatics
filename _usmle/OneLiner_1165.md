Asbestosis, a chronic lung disease that predisposes patients to lung cancer, is caused by inhaling asbestos fibers -- a hazard associated with working in shipbuilding, roofing, and plumbing. The risk of developing bronchogenic carcinoma is typically greater than the risk of developing mesothelioma. Smoking increases the risk of bronchogenic carcinoma and mesothelioma in individuals exposed to asbestos; however, smoking alone does not increase oneâ€™s risk of mesothelioma.
