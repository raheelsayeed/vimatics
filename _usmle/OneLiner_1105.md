A. israelli appear as gram-positive branching rods with clustering that forms "sulfur granules" in the thick yellow exudate. Trauma associated with dental work often leads to the invasion of A. israelli into the cervicofacial area. Infection caused by these organisms typically presents as a chronic, slowly progressing mass that eventually evolves into a draining sinus tract. First-line treatment involves administration of penicillin G, an antibiotic that inhibits transpeptidase cross-linking and thus prevents cell wall synthesis, and surgical debridement.
