HIV enters the host cell by binding its viral envelope glycoprotein (gp120) to the host cell′s CD4 glycoprotein. This interaction induces a conformational change in gp120. The altered gp120 then binds the host cell′s co-receptor, CXCR4 (on T cells), or CCR5 (on T cells and macrophages). Another viral envelope glycoprotein (gp41) is brought closer to the host cell, and it then mediates the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell′s lipid membrane. Entry inhibitors may act either by blocking the interaction between gp120 and CD4 or by interfering with gp41-mediated fusion.
