Acute organophosphate poisoning, which is characterized by excess cholinergic symptoms of bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, hypersalivation, diaphoresis, lacrimation, blurred vision, and miosis. The lacrimal gland cells contain muscarinic3 (M3) receptors, which transmit their signal via the phospholipase C/phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate/inositol triphosphate (phospholipase C-PIP2-IP3) pathway. Other types of receptors that function in the same way are the histamine1 (H1) receptors of the respiratory tract, Î±1 sympathetic receptors, vasopressin1 (V1) receptors, and M3 parasympathetic receptors.
