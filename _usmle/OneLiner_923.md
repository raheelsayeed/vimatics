A significant disadvantage of indirect-acting sympathomimetics lies in their ability to enter the central nervous system and produce undesirable stimulation because they are not specific for a particular receptor. Conversely, direct-acting sympathomimetics do not enter the CNS as readily, and they have more predictable effects due to their selective receptor-binding activity. As a result, direct-acting sympathomimetics can be used to modulate autonomic function less diffusely.
