Necrotizing enterocolitis typically occurs around 10-12 days of life when breakdown of the intestinal barrier leads to widespread necrosis and ischemia of the bowel wall. Patients present with bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, bloody stools, and unstable vital signs. This patientâ€™s very young age and otherwise stable vitals are unconvincing for necrotizing enterocolitis.
