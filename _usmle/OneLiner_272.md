Giardia involves CD4+T helper cells & secretory IgA production. Secretory IgA helps prevent & clear infection by binding to trophozoites & impairing their adherence to the upper small-bowel mucosa. Children with IgA deficiency, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, & CVID have a predisposition to developing chronic giardiasis.
