In patients with asthma, chronic inflammation of the airways leads to increased bronchiolar mucus secretion and smooth muscle contractility. This can result in obstructive lung disease and lung hyperinflation. Leukotriene (LT) C4, LTD4, and LTE4 are bronchoconstrictors. Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (via zileuton) to block leukotriene synthesis and inhibition of leukotriene receptors (via montelukast or zafirlukast) can alleviate asthma symptoms, although these medications are typically not first-line.
