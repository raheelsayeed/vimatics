Antipsychotics, also known as neuroleptics, block the dopamine D2 receptor in the mesolimbic pathway in order to decrease the positive symptoms associated with schizophrenia.  However, these drugs also block dopamine receptors in other pathways. The nigrostriatal pathway is one of the four main dopaminergic pathways in the brain, and it is involved in the extrapyramidal motor loop that connects the substantia nigra to the dorsal striatum. This motor loop regulates background motor tone.
