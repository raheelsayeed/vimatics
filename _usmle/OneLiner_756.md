SMX inhibits the bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid, and TMP inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, thereby blocking the production of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolic acid. Together they block two steps in the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins that bacteria need. The combination of TMP and SMX is bactericidal, although each drug alone is bacteriostatic.
