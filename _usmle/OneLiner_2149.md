Metaplasia, which is characterized by one differentiated adult cell type replaced by another differentiated cell type. Change is reversible. Normal bronchi are lined with pseudostratified, columnar, ciliated epithelium (with goblet cells). Squamous epithelia in the bronchi are not normal, and are often a sign of environmental exposure and/or irritation (eg, smoking).
