Heroin and other opiates primarily function by stimulation of µ-receptors in the brain and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. μ-Receptor stimulation is responsible not only for the pleasure sensation derived from opiates, but also for the decreased bowel motility and constipation with which opiates are associated. Narcotic pain medications have similar adverse effects, because they are opiate-derived drugs.
