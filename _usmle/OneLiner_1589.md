Autosomal dominant dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (vWF). vWF has two main functions: (1) adhesion of platelets to collagen via glycoproteins, and (2) as a carrier molecule for factor VIII. Thus vWD results in decreased factor VIII levels and a prolonged partial thromboplastin time. Reduced ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation is a specific and sensitive test of plasma vWF activity.
