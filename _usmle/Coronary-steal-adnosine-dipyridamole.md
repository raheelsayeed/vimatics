#### CORONARY STEAL

Imagine a coronary artery splitting into two branches,  one of them has a athersclerotic plaque.


Coronary blood supply --> Two branches --> One ischemic, other: non ischemic area --> Adenosine/Dipyridamole application (vasodilation) --> blood supply sort of pulled into the artery with less pressure (no obstruction) --> Increase supply to non-ischemic area, Decreased supply to ischemic area
