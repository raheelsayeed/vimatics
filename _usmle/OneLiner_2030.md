A strawberry hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor also known as infantile hemangioma or capillary hemangioma. These lesions are most commonly found in infants and children. Strawberry hemangiomas enlarge rapidly and most regress spontaneously by eight years of age. They are bright red to violaceous in color and may be found anywhere on the skin.
