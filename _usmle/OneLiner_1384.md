Alzheimer disease is the most common cause of dementia. It is caused by degeneration of the prefrontal cortex, leading to global loss of cognitive ability. There are no focal neurological deficits. Alzheimer disease is characterized by loss of acetylcholine, due to deficiency of choline acetyltransferase. This loss is most prominent in the basal nucleus of Meynert and the hippocampus.
