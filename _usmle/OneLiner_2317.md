Activation of α1-receptors is not the correct mechanism underlying the patient’s orthostatic hypotension because α1-receptor activity leads to an increase in vascular smooth muscle contraction. Blockade of α1-receptors, leading to increased generation of cAMP and protein kinase A is not the correct mechanism because it does not pair the receptor blockade with the correct signaling outcome. Additionally, β2-receptor blockadeleads to bronchoconstriction and vasoconstriction, and H1-receptor blockade leads to sedation, none of which are present in this patient.
