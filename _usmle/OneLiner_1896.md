Increased hemoglobin, increased biphosphoglyerate, and increased renal HCO3- excretion are chronic compensatory mechanisms that occur when a person is exposed to decreased atmospheric oxygen (high altitude) over several days, but are less important acutely. Ventilation is increased, not decreased, in response to decreased atmospheric oxygen to compensate for the hypoxia. PaO2 is decreased, not increased, in exposure to high altitude due to decreased atmospheric pressure.
