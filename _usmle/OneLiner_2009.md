Increased serotonin levels are associated with carcinoid tumors, which are malignant neuroendocrine tumors that tend to arise in the gastrointestinal tract, the bronchus, or thymus. These tumors may secrete substances such as serotonin, and, when they metastasize, may cause carcinoid syndrome (symptoms include bronchoconstriction, cutaneous flushing, diarrhea, and right-sided valvular heart disease).
