MS â€“ PT presents with urinary frequency & urge incontinence in the setting of an overactive or spastic bladder due to UMN lesion in the spinal cord. Urodynamic studies show little to no residual urine after bladder emptying. Bladder does not distend/relax due to loss of descending inhibitory control of the UMN.
