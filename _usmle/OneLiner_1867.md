Patient presents with sudden-onset right-sided hemiparesis and difficulty speaking, which suggest a stroke. Speech is nonfluent and repetition is impaired, but comprehension is intact. This is referred to as an expressive aphasia. Because patient is right-handed, it is assumed that her language center is located in the left hemisphere (for left-handed individuals, there is also a left-hemisphere language predominance). Expressive aphasia, also known as Broca aphasia, occurs with a lesion in Broca’s area, most likely located on the left inferior frontal gyrus for this patient. Due to its proximity to the primary motor cortex, lesions involving Broca’s area also often cause paralysis of the lower face and arm, which explains the right-sided hemiparesis.
