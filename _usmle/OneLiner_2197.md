Tight junctions, also called zona occludens, are located just below the luminal surface of simple columnar cells, where they seal the intercellular spaces so that molecules present in the luminal side are unable to pass between the cells and reach the basal side of the cell. These structures therefore create polarity in the cells, allowing certain gradients and specific transport to occur only in distinct lymphocyte surfaces. Unlike desmosomes, these structures do not serve to bind cells together.
