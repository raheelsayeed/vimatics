Acute mesenteric ischemia caused by arterial thrombosis -> Known atherosclerotic disease (coronary artery disease) and delayed postprandial abdominal pain -> abdominal angina -> extreme abdominal pain. Initial findings are relatively benign, but can later develop peritoneal signs consistent with bowel perforation -> septic shock. Full-thickness necrosis of the small bowel is consistent with ischemic necrosis. History of abdominal angina, an analogue of cardiac angina, in which peristaltic activity about 20â€“30 minutes after a meal increases oxygen demand by the bowel, outpacing arterial supply through atherosclerotic vessels.
