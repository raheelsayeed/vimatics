### Measure Reverse T3!

From [suzycohen](https://suzycohen.com/articles/reverse-t3/)

      > First the basics.  The hormone called T3 gives you energy, so it’s sometimes called the gas pedal in your body.  Reverse T3, abbreviated as rT3, would then be the brakes. You sometimes want to use the brakes, don’t you?  If you don’t have brakes, your body will speed away on the highway and zoom out of control, so rT3 is required as part of your body’s  push/pull balancing system.  It’s the isomer of thyroid hormone that looks like it’s the reverse (opposite) of the active T3.  Picture your left hand as your rT3 and your right hand as your T3.
