Patients who have polio may experience injury to the nerve roots. In this type of injury, the left hip drops when weight is put entirely on the right leg during the stance phase of walking (as shown in the diagrams). The patient is unable to swing his left leg forward unless he leans to the right; this is called the Trendelenburg gait. In the Trendelenburg gait, the patient leans on the affected side, and the hip that drops is contralateral to the injured nerve, the right superior gluteal nerve.
