Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with a rapid rate and irregularly shaped P waves. Treat with verapamil, a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker commonly used for short-term management of SVT. By inhibiting the voltage-dependent calcium channels in cardiac pacemaker cells and slowing the rate of recovery, diltiazem will decrease the rate at which impulses generated by ectopic foci in the atria are transmitted through the atrioventricular (AV) node. As a result, the PR interval will be prolonged, and the ventricles will be protected from rapid successions of impulses generated from the ectopic atrial foci, making this medication useful for preventing nodal arrhythmias. Diltiazem blocks L-type calcium channels in cardiac myocytes (including cardiac cells that comprise the heart's conduction system).
