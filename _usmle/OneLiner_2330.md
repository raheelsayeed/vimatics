Naegleria fowleri,which manifests with a rapidly progressing meningoencephalitis that can progress to coma or death within 6 days. The initial symptoms are indistinguishable from bacterial meningitis, including nausea, vomiting, seizures (this patientâ€™s presenting symptom), and altered mental status. Infection typically occurs through swimming or diving in warm freshwater lakes or rivers. When water containing the ameba enters the body through the nose, the pathogen gains access to the CNS through the cribriform plate. Microscopic analysis will reveal amoebas in the spinal fluid. Although amphotericin B has been effective in some cases of N. fowleri infection, the fatality rate for this rapidly progressing infection is over 97%.
