ACE inhibitors can prevent cardiovascular remodeling in diabetes and CHF, although the exact mechanism behind this phenomenon is unclear. ACE inhibitors, such as lisinopril, lower blood pressure by decreasing levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone, which in turn cause arteriolar and venous vasodilation. Blocking the constrictive effects of angiotensin II on the efferent arteriole in the renal filtration system can protect against damage due to diabetic proteinuria. Decreased levels of aldosterone, however, can lead to potassium retention in the collecting ducts, or hyperkalemia. The most common adverse effects of ACE inhibitors include hypotension, dry cough, hyperkalemia, renal insufficiency, and angioedema. ACE inhibitors are also teratogenic and can lead to fetal renal damage.
