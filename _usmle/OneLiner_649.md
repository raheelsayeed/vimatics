Inhibition of cleavage of viral polyproteins describes the mechanism of protease inhibitors (eg, indinavir), which are not used to treat CMV retinitis. Adverse effects include hyperglycemia, gastrointestinal intolerance, and lipodystrophy. Indinavir may cause nephropathy, but it is also associated with thrombocytopenia, which is not seen in this patient.
