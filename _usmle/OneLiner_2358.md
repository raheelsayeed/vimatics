β1 > β2 > α: Dobutamine is a sympathomimetic drug that is specific to β1-adrenergic receptors. The physiologic effects of dobutamine include increasing heart rate and contractility, which would be useful in the management of cardiogenic shock, rather than septic shock as seen in this patient. Because of its limited α1-adrenergic receptor activity, dobutamine would not induce sufficient vasoconstriction.
