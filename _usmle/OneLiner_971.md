Activation of G-proteinâ€“coupled receptors in the adrenal cortex elevates cAMP levels and leads to increased production and secretion of corticosteroids. This describes the mechanism of hormones including ACTH, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and does not describe the biological mechanisms initiated by ectopic ADH production.
