Corynebacterium diphtheria is a club-shaped gram-positive rod; initial symptoms of infection are sore throat, low-grade fever, malaise, and an adherent gray pseudomembrane over the tonsils, pharynx, and/or nasal cavity. Bordetella pertussis is a gram-negative coccobacillus and is characterized by an inspiratory whoop and posttussive vomiting.
