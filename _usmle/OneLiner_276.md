Warfarin inhibits new vitamin K-dependent clothing factors, therapeutic efficacy is delayed until preexisting clothing factors in the plasma are consumed -> INR tends to slowly increase in the first few days of administration due to short half-life of factor VII (4-6 hours) but full therapeutic effect does not typically occur for 3 days due to long half-life of factor II.
