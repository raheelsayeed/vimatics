A patient with arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis after treatment for chlamydial infection (obligate intracellular organism) is presenting with reactive arthritis. It is characterized by the triad of conjunctivitis, urethritis and arthritis and is formerly known as Reiter syndrome.  Sacroiliitis is a painful condition where either one or both of the sacroiliac joints become inflamed and can be a symptom of reactive arthritis. Sexually transmitted infections as well as gastrointestinal infections may precipitate reactive arthritis. The following bacteria have been implicated: Shigella, Yersinia, Chlamydia, Campylobacterand Salmonella.
