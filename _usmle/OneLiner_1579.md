After confirmation of ischemic stroke -> within the past 3â€“4.5 hours, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) can be administered -> stimulating the production of plasmin, which breaks down fibrin, ultimately dissolving the clot. Potential adverse effects of tPA: excessive bleeding (e.g. bleeding from gums and developing subcutaneous ecchymoses). Stop the bleeding -> Aminocaproic acid, which is an antifibrinolytic that acts by blocking the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, effectively counteracting the mechanism of tPA.
