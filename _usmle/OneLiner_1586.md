This patient presents with urinary incontinence, gait disturbances, and cognitive impairment (difficulty paying bills, memory impairment regarding falls) along with expanded ventricles shown in the CT scan. This presentation is consistent with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which is a condition of the elderly characterized by chronically dilated ventricles. NPH is a type of communicating hydrocephalus.
