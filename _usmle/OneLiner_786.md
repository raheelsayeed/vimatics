Subdural hemorrhages or hematomas result from the rupture of bridging veins (due to trauma or other underlying cause). They are especially common in elderly patients because of normal cortical atrophy that results in unsupported bridging veins susceptible to damage. Because venous bleeding is relatively slow, gradual progression of symptoms may be seen.
