A patient presents with severe pain after sustaining a blow to the posterior of the knee playing football. His knee was originally bent, but now it is extended on the bed. He lacks pulses in the lower leg, and his toes appear dusky. The sensation is also decreased in his lower leg. He most likely suffered a popliteal dislocation, which has interrupted the blood supply to the lower leg by severing the popliteal artery, causing most of his symptoms. Knee dislocation, even when reduced has the same rate of injury to the popliteal artery. If this artery is damaged, it can quickly lead to complications causing amputation of the leg. Posterior knee trauma is the most common cause of injury to the popliteal artery. An arteriogram or doppler study may be necessary, depending on the severity of the injury. The priority is to preserve the limb. Fasciotomy maybe needed if reduction is delayed.
