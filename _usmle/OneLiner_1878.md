Crohn disease>> insidious nature of abdominal pain, and non bloody diarrhea.  Additionally, Crohn disease is an idiopathic (likely autoimmune) condition that results in inflammation and may be complicated by the formation of fistulas.  Other gross features of Crohn disease include skip lesions, cobblestone mucosa, and deep fissures. Microscopically, transmural inflammation and noncaseating granulomas are indicative of Crohn disease. Difference bt Crohn disease & ulcerative colitis, in which the inflammation affects the mucosa and submucosa only, with formation of characteristic pseudopolyps (ulcerative colitis)
